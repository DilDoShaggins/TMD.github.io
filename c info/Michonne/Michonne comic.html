							<th height="250" width="600"> Michonne is introduced as a mysterious woman armed with a katana. She first appears towing two armless, jawless zombies in shackles and causes no small consternation among the group. She saves Otis from zombies and follows him to the abandoned prison where the group is based. She immediately bonds with Tyreese, recognizing him from his days in the NFL, and shares his passion for weightlifting. Having seduced him, she precipitates the breakup of Tyreese and Carol, which results in a relationship between Tyreese and Michonne. </th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th height="50" width="600"> Michonne reveals some details of her life before the apocalypse. She was a lawyer who had recently ended her marriage and lost all her children. At first, she appears to have suffered some kind of trauma or mental illness, often carrying on conversations with herself or with her deceased boyfriend, as Andrea first notices in the prison. Michonne later admits to Rick Grimes that she has imaginary conversations with her dead boyfriend to keep herself from breaking down, and as a coping mechanism to deal with the real world's horrors. In return, Rick shows her a rotary telephone he used to "call" his wife, Lori. Michonne appears to be reassured about her mental health. </th>

						<tr>
							<th height="50" width="600"> Michonne is among the small group sent out to investigate the recent crash of a helicopter, and they stumble upon the town of Woodbury. The Governor betrays and captures them, and violently rapes and tortures Michonne He soon realizes she must be dealt with more aggressively when she kills all the participants in a gladiator-style tournament. The group escapes, but Michonne remains behind, saying "she has to take care of some things". She sadistically tortures the Governor before making her way back to the prison with the rest of the group. When the Governor retaliates, Michonne and Tyreese go on the offensive, attempting guerrilla warfare in order to buy the prison time to prepare for the next attack. Instead Michonne is forced to flee after nearly being captured, and Tyreese is captured and used as a bargaining tool to get into the prison. When this fails, the Governor kills Tyreese with Michonne's katana. Moments later, she returns and reclaims her sword, disappearing into the woods nearby. </th>

When she finds only footprints, she begins to follow them and stumbles upon Rick and his son, Carl. She saves Carl from a roamer and joins up with Rick and Carl. She bonds with them and keeps Rick's self-conversations secret. Michonne protects Carl as a mother would, and goes to great lengths to protect Rick out of respect for him. They rejoin other surviving members of the group at Hershel's farm. </th>

							<th height="50" width="1500"> Michonne travels with the survivors in search of safety, and inquires about Morgan Jones' whereabouts. When Rick asks if she finds Morgan attractive, Michonne admits that she does, but is still grieving over Tyreese's death. When the survivors locate the town of Alexandria, a safe haven from the undead, and think they have finally been given an opportunity to rest, Michonne has a difficult time relinquishing her sword, as seen with her confrontation with Alexandria resident Douglas. Another resident, Olivia, persuades Douglas to allow Michonne to keep her weapon. Michonne settles into her new "home" and even hangs her sword above the mantle. She recalls all of the horrific ways she has used it to survive, and finally proclaims, "I am through with you." </th>

							<th height="50" width="1500"> Michonne begins to let her guard down, and Rick asks Douglas if there is a job for her in the community. Since there is no need for lawyers, Douglas recommends making her a constable to uphold the law in Alexandria. Michonne attends a welcome party held by Douglas in honor of Alexandria's new residents, but is quiet and reserved during the festivities. When one of Alexandria's residents, Barbara, tries playing matchmaker between Michonne and a young man named Heath, Michonne wearies of the conversation among the partygoers and attempts to leave. Barbara makes a well-intentioned attempt to dissuade her, but becomes insistent about what Michonne would care to eat and says she'd hate to cook a meal Michonne did not enjoy. Michonne snaps and asks if that's all she truly concerns herself about. The guests grow silent. Michonne, uncomfortable, leaves. </th>

Michonne admits their conversation made her feel even more alone. She lets her guard down and rests her head on Morgan's shoulder. They end up having sex that night, but Michonne is annoyed and turned off by Morgan's refusal to let go of the fact that his wife is dead and gone. </th>

The two ultimately get a chance to make up afterwards, with her agreeing to take things slow and get to know each other better. She's devastated when he gets bitten, amputating his arm in an attempt to save his life. Michonne later apologizes to a seemingly-unconscious Morgan. She says she doesn't mean to be an insensitive person and asks for his forgiveness, only to realize he has already died. </th>

Rick finds Michonne sitting at Morgan's grave, and she says she would have lived with Morgan for the rest of her life. Michonne asks Rick if this is funny, to which he replies everyone wants a relationship, and Michonne says she doesn't think she will ever be happy. Michonne helps in clearing up the last of the zombie horde in Alexandria and Rick approaches her, asking how she feels. Michonne replies that she is getting by, and thinks it's nice someone cares about her. </th>

Paul reveals he has traveled from a community nearby and wishes to establish an alliance between them all. Rick lashes out at Paul, knocking him unconscious, and Michonne helps in tying him up. Rick, Michonne, and Abraham set out to scout the area for an impending threat, but realize Paul was telling the truth, and Rick decides to work with him. Rick, Michonne, Paul, Glenn, Carl and Andrea travel to Paul's community, the "Hilltop".

The Saviors keep the area clear of the dead in exchange for half of everything the Hilltop survivors manage to gather. However, the Saviors have been abusing members of the Hilltop Colony and Rick volunteers to help deal with Negan, a decision Michonne seems angry about. The group is attacked by a group of Saviors on their way back to Alexandria, but Rick's group emerges victorious and kills all but one of them. Rick spares him so he can deliver a message to Negan, saying they are protecting Hilltop now and want half of Negan's supplies. </th>

Michonne travels with Rick, Carl, Glenn, Maggie and Sophia to Hilltop, but they are captured by Negan along the way. Negan savagely bashes Glenn's head in with a baseball bat and leaves the other survivors, saying they will be back to collect half of Alexandria's supplies. Michonne and the others return to Alexandria, to find a battle has taken place between the Safe Zone and the Saviors, resulting in Rick's group capturing one of Negan's men. Rick lets the man go free, but Carl disappears sometime later, and Michonne joins Rick, Andrea, and Jesus on a trip to Negan's community, suspecting the Saviors have kidnapped Carl. After a brief scuffle between Negan and Rick, it is revealed Carl is safe and they return to Alexandria. </th>

Michonne and Carl are later seen fighting a group of walkers, and Carl is surprised by one of them, which falls on top of him. Carl says he is useless with only one eye, but Michonne assures him Rick is fine with only one hand.

She and Ezekiel become romantically involved, despite starting off on the wrong foot. Michonne participates in the war against Negan and the Saviors, which ends in Rick's group emerging victorious and imprisoning Negan. Michonne presumably resides in the Kingdom with Ezekiel, because she is not seen for a prolonged period of time, and Rick states that he still misses her "even after all this time." </th>

The conversation ends with Rick telling her to "get her shit together" and to "go back home." </th>
