          <p height="10" width="250">In the season premiere, "30 Days Without an Accident", six months after the conflict with the Governor has ended, Carol begins secretly teaching the children of the prison how to use knives to defend themselves and not to have any sympathy for the walkers. Carl Grimes discovers the lessons are taking place, and she tells him not to tell his father. In the episode, "Infected", Carol begins caring for two girls, Lizzie (Brighton Sharbino) and Mika (Kyla Kenedy), after their father is bitten by a walker and has to be put down. This makes Carol even more determined to keep those she cares about safe. In the episode, "Isolation", when a new disease starts spreading in the prison, two people who are infected are killed Karen (Melissa Ponzio) the Woodbury survivor and girlfriend of Tyreese (Chad L. Coleman), and prison newcomer David. Unknown to the other survivors, Carol mercifully killed them in their sleep to stop the infection from spreading. An enraged Tyreese finds the burned bodies and attacks Rick while Carol watches, and later demands that Rick find the killer. Despite the deaths of Karen and David, the infection continues to spread. Carol discovers Lizzie is ill, but reassures her that she will be fine. Tyreese asks Carol to look after his sister, Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green), who is also ill, believing Carol is a very caring person, which upsets Carol even more. Later, she is shown recklessly pumping up water despite knowing walkers are nearby, and is forced to flee as Rick shoots them down to save her. Rick soon uncovers the truth and confronts Carol over the murders. In the episode, "Indifference", Rick and Carol go on a supply run together to gather medical supplies to help Hershel. Carol talks more about her past, revealing her late husband pushed her down the stairs on at least three occasions and she learned how to fix a dislocated arm because she was too afraid to go to the hospital. They discuss the murders of Karen and David and Carol explains that, at the time, she believed killing them would stop the spread of the infection, therefore saving the lives of everyone else in the prison. During the supply run, Rick sees how different Carol has become and ultimately decides that she cannot return to the prison. He sees her as a threat, but is also concerned that Tyreese will kill her when he finds out that she murdered Karen. Carol is forced to leave on her own, leaving everyone she cares about behind.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">In the episode "Inmates", Carol reappears unexpectedly, saving Lizzie, Mika, and Judith from a pair of Walkers in a forest. She returns the children to Tyreese and tells him that she saw the prison fall, and, after losing sight of him and the children, managed to catch up with them. Sensing that Tyreese does not know of her involvement in Karen's death, Carol makes up a story about how she did not return with Rick because she wanted to find more supplies for the group. Later, after taking the advice of a man who had been bitten on the side of the road, she follows Tyreese and the children as they to travel to a sanctuary named "Terminus". In the episode "The Grove" Carol and her group take a break from following the train tracks to Terminus, and find a house in the middle of a pecan grove. Carol is concerned that Mika is too gentle to survive, and that Lizzie is confused about the nature of walkers, thinking that they are still people. She continues to teach Lizzie and Mika lessons of survival, despite the girls remaining adamant to surviving in their own methods. Carol and Tyreese later return from a hunting trip to find that Lizzie has killed Mika and was about to kill Judith, thinking that everyone would understand that Mika was just a changed person after reanimating as a walker. Viewing Lizzie as too dangerous to be around other people, Carol and Tyreese discuss Lizzie's fate, and Carol is forced to execute Lizzie by shooting her in the head. Afterward, Carol confesses to Tyreese her role in killing Karen and David. Tyreese is furious, but he forgives Carol for what she did, although he says he will not forget. After burying the two girls' bodies, Tyreese, Carol, and baby Judith restart their trek toward Terminus.</p>
