          <h3 style="text-align:center;">Carol Peletier</h3>  
          <p height="50" width="201"> <img src="../../../img/c_pictures/Carol Peletier.jpg"> </p>
          <p height="10" width="250">Carol Peletier is a fictional character from the comic book series The Walking Dead and is portrayed by Melissa McBride in the American television series of the same name. Carol is introduced in the comics in the third issue of the first volume, "Days Gone Bye", in 2003, and the third episode of the first season of the television series in 2010, as a meek housewife and mother of Sophia at the survival camp in Atlanta, Georgia. Initially a recurring cast member, McBride was upgraded to a series regular position at the onset of the second season, and the character's role has predominantly increased since the fourth season. The character's arc has been described as a "hero's journey" by executive producer Scott M. Gimple, having made many difficult decisions in order to survive.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">The direction of her character is contrasted between the two mediums. In the comic series, Carol is a 24-year-old housewife who exhibits a neurotic, self-centered, and naive demeanor. Throughout her time in the comics, she grows increasingly unstable, to the extent of self-destruction and ultimately commits suicide. The television show differs in these regards, as she is shown to be a stern, ruthlessly pragmatic, but compassionate individual who has been gradually building inner strength. She is shown to be much more capable and emotionally stable than her comic book counterpart. The abuse she faced by her husband was explicitly shown in the show whereas it was merely hinted at in the comics. In addition, Carol and Tyreese have a brief romantic relationship before they break up while in the television series it is a close but complex group bond.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">In the television series, Carol evacuated her home with her abusive husband Ed and her daughter Sophia in hopes of a safe haven in Atlanta. Nearing their destination, she came into the company of Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) and Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal), who had evacuated the city. The Peletiers then joined a camp of survivors. Following the deaths of her husband and daughter, Carol formed a close bond with fellow Atlanta camp survivors Lori and Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus), and she became the surrogate mother to Lizzie and Mika Samuels (Brighton Sharbino and Kyla Kenedy) after the death of their father, Ryan, and formed a close, but complex bond with Tyreese (Chad Coleman) during the fall of the prison.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">As of the end of the show's third season, she is the last remaining female survivor from the original Atlanta group, and one of the last original survivors overall, preceded by Rick (Andrew Lincoln), Carl (Chandler Riggs), Glenn (Steven Yeun), and followed by Daryl in order of appearance. Carol is also the series' longest-living female character as of season six, and the only female character to have appeared in every season. She has appeared in the most episodes of any female character in the series to date. McBride's performance as Carol has received critical acclaim from television commentators, and some critics have referred to Carol as the series' best character.</p>

          <p height="50" width="201"> <img src="../../../img/comic_images/Carol comic.jpg"> </p>          
          <p height="10" width="250">Carol is described in the comics as being a housewife who occasionally helps pay the family's bills by selling kitchen appliances online. She endured a rather unsatisfactory marriage, and it is implied that she only married (and continued to stay with) her husband because of her frequent need for attention and comfort. During the initial stages of the outbreak, her husband commits suicide after losing his parents to walkers, leaving Carol and their daughter Sophia to fend for themselves. Carol is in the process of moving herself and Sophia to her sister's in Atlanta when they meet and eventually join Shane's settlement of survivors on the outskirts of the city.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">While in the camp, she usually assists the other mothers in domestic duties such as washing clothes and looking after the children. She and Lori quickly become best friends, the two of them often conversing about the current happenings around them. Carol is often Lori's shoulder to cry on, as well as the one person to whom she can vent about her various frustrations.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">After leaving their first campsite, they meet Tyreese, whom Carol grows to like. Eventually, the two became romantically attached to one another, and they stay close throughout their stay at Hershel's farm and their arrival at the abandoned prison.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">Tension begins between Tyreese and Carol, however, when Michonne is introduced, and Carol later witnesses Michonne performing oral sex on Tyreese inside of the prison gymnasium. This initially leads her to try and compete, albeit degradingly, for his affection but she ultimately breaks off the relationship and tries avoiding further confrontations.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">Soon after the break-up, her mental health comes into question, and, after nights of crying, results in an attempt to commit suicide. Soon after cutting herself, Carol becomes desperate for companionship and wants to have a polyamorous relationship with Rick and Lori, only to be turned down.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">As she plans to commit suicide, she makes sure Lori promises to take care of Sophia. She then initiates sex with Hershel's son, Billy. After wandering through the prison courtyard and talking to a zombie, she allows it to tear at her jugular. She refuses for anyone to try and help her, saying that they should let her die in peace. She is killed by a merciful Andrea during her reanimation process before she can bite a saddened Tyreese.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">Carol's death leaves a significant mark on the group in the days leading up to the ultimate assault on the prison. Many look down upon her manner of death and are disgusted by the fact that she abandoned her only living family. Sophia is left in a catatonic state as the news reaches her, and has since attempted to repress all memories of Carol by pretending that Maggie and Glenn are her biological parents. Maggie is relieved when Sophia begins to speak openly about recognizing Carol's previous existence. At the Hilltop Colony with Carl Grimes, Sophia reminisces on life at the prison with her mother, reminding him that she remembers everything that has happened to them, especially the death of her mother.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">Before the apocalypse began, Carol was a meek and battered housewife. She frequently avoided confrontation with her husband Ed in attempt to stifle his anger, though she secretly prayed to God that he be punished for abusing her and for his sexual interest in their young daughter Sophia (Madison Lintz). The Peletiers first met up with Shane (Jon Bernthal), Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) and her son Carl (Chandler Riggs) while traveling toward a supposed 'safe zone' in Atlanta, and they all eventually settled near a quarry on the outskirts of Atlanta with a handful of other survivors. Within her time at the camp, she regularly performed domestic duties such as washing and ironing clothes for her and her fellow survivors, usually with help from some of the other women in the group.</p>
