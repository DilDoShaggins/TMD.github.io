          <p height="10" width="250">The second season (2011=12) depicts Carol's struggle with the disappearance and later death of her daughter. In the season premiere "What Lies Ahead", following the CDC explosion, a swarm of walkers attacks the group while they stall on a highway, and Sophia is lost in the woods after being chased by one of them. Carol casts the blame upon Rick for not staying with her as he finds her in the woods, chasing off the walkers who follow her but ultimately blames herself. In the episode "Save the Last One", as the search for Sophia goes on, her hope begins to diminish, but she refuses to give up and insists that the group keep searching (even after the group is split up when Carl is shot). Eventually, she seems to be shutting down emotionally, refusing anyone's attempt to console her. In the episode "Cherokee Rose", Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) gives her a flower later on which inspires hope in her to keep strong and believing in Sophia's survival. In the episode "Chupacabra", having been staying at the farm owned by Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson), she decides to cook dinner for Hershel and the rest of the group with Lori as a token of gratitude. During the dinner, she brings up a plate to Daryl and kisses him on the cheek, acknowledging how noble and caring he is (compared to her deceased husband). In the mid-season finale "Pretty Much Dead Already", Carol and Daryl begin to form a deeper bond, with her being concerned for his well-being. Glenn reveals to the group that Hershel's barn is full of walkers, and Shane eventually breaks the barn open. The group executes the walkers one by one as they file out of the barn. The last walker to exit the barn is Sophia, revealing that the search for Carol's daughter has been in vain, as Sophia has been one of the undead for some time. Carol cries as Daryl comforts her, watching helplessly as Rick shoots Sophia. In the mid-season premiere "Nebraska", Carol refuses to attend Sophia's memorial service, saying that her daughter died a long time ago and the corpse at the farm was not Sophia. In the episode "Triggerfinger", Carol shows a conscious concern for Daryl's detachment from the group. She later lets him vent his frustration at her, as he mocks her for losing her family but soon apologizes and returns to the fold. Over time, Carol's meekness diminishes as she gains the self-confidence to stand up for herself. She grows tired of the arguments of the group, and refuses to choose the fate of their prisoner, Randall in the episode "Judge, Jury, Executioner". In the finale "Beside the Dying Fire", the group are chased off the farm by walkers. Daryl rescues Carol on his motorcycle, and they eventually meet up with the remaining survivors. The slight blame she has cast upon Rick accumulates into outright questioning of his leadership.</p>
