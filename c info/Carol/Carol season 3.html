          <p height="10" width="250">In the season premiere "Seed", set eight months after leaving Hershel's farm, Carol has grown increasingly proficient with weapons, as well as having been taught by Hershel how to handle medical situations. She has become much more self-confident and has acquired a playful side as the group settles in to an abandoned prison. Carol has also grown increasingly close to Lori because of the latter's pregnancy. Her trust in Rick has been regained, convincing herself that they would not have survived as long as they have if Shane was in charge. In the episode "Sick", Carol and Lori tend to Hershel after his leg is amputated to prevent the spread of infection from a walker bite. Carol later kills a female walker and uses its corpse to practice performing a C-section in preparation for Lori's pregnancy. In the episode "Killer Within", Carol and T-Dog are cut off from the rest of the group after former inmate Andrew releases walkers into the prison. T-Dog, after being bitten in the shoulder, sacrifices himself to a group of walkers to give Carol time to escape. Her fate is left unknown at the end of the episode, but the group concludes that she was killed. In the episode "Hounded" Daryl rediscovers her in a solitary confinement cell, malnourished and weak but alive. He carries her off in his arms and in the next episode, "When the Dead Come Knocking", the group happily reunites with her; however, things once again take a sad turn when she realizes that Lori has died in childbirth. She and Rick tearfully mourn Lori's loss and Carol is seen taking care of Lori's child, Judith, while Daryl leaves for Woodbury. As Daryl tells Carol to keep safe, she responds saying, "Nine lives, remember?". In the mid-season finale "Made to Suffer", Carol reprimands Axel for flirting with seventeen-year-old Beth Greene. Learning that Carol isn't a lesbian (as he had inferred from Carol's short hairstyle), Axel propositions her, but she flatly turns him down.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">In the mid-season premiere "The Suicide King", when Daryl is reunited with his brother Merle, Rick pleads with Daryl to stay with the group, on the grounds that Carol will be crushed by his disappearance; Daryl replies that Carol will understand. When Carol finds out Daryl is gone, she is deeply upset at first but quickly comes to terms with it and even agrees with his decision. In the episode "Home", Carol and Axel begin setting up barricades in the prison in preparation for the impending showdown with The Governor; however, the Governor launches a surprise attack as he shoots Axel in the head and Carol is forced to use his body as a shield when incoming gunfire ensues. In the episode "I Ain't a Judas", Daryl returns with Merle to help defend the prison, and after the attack Carol expresses to Daryl that she is glad he came back. When Andrea arrives at the prison to negotiate with the group, she happily reunites with Carol, who explains what has happened to the deceased members of their group since she was separated, and informs her that she needs to kill the Governor to end the conflict. Carol gives Andrea a knife to use to stab him in his sleep after sleeping with him. Andrea, however, is unable to go along with Carol's plan. In the episode "This Sorrowful Life", Merle has a brief conversation with Carol wherein he remarks that she has transformed from a "scared little mouse afraid of her own shadow" into a stronger person. She replies that she was not scared of her own shadow but that of her husband and further states that she is no longer afraid of anything. To prove the latter, she sternly admonishes Merle to "pick a side", regarding his previous loyalty to The Governor. In the season finale "Welcome to the Tombs", following Merle's death at the hands of The Governor, Carol praises him for his sacrifice, that he gave them a chance though Daryl remarked that Merle had never performed an altruistic deed in his life. Carol then helps defend the gate against walkers as Rick, Daryl, and Michonne drive out to carry the fight to Woodbury. She is seen beginning to cry upon realizing that Andrea has died at the end of the episode, and watches the remaining Woodbury residents enter their new home in the prison.</p>
