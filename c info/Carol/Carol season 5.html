          <h3 style="text-align:center;">Carol Peletier</h3>  
          <p height="50" width="201"> <img src="../../../img/c_pictures/Carol Peletier.jpg"> </p>
          <p height="10" width="250">In the season premiere "No Sanctuary", Carol infiltrates Terminus, blowing up the propane tank and unleashing a herd of walkers, approaching the complex inside, sooner. This causes the compound to become overrun and destroyed, thus allowing the group to escape. After killing many residents, she escapes and has an emotional reunion with Daryl, Rick and the others. Rick is overwhelmed with gratitude. Rick, Carl, and Sasha are further overjoyed when she leads the group back to the cabin where Tyreese is with Judith. In the episode "Strangers", Tyreese tells Carol that the others accept Carol's killing of Karen and David. Both remained scarred over the deaths of Mika and Lizzie. Rick says that he owes her everything and is apologetic about banishing her and Carol tells him, "You said I could survive. You were right." Daryl respects Carol's wishes not to speak about what happened to her in the events of her exile and the prison downfall. Daryl tries to reassure Carol that they can start over. Carol and Daryl later follow the car that took Beth Greene (Emily Kinney) and drives off in pursuit of it. In the episode "Slabtown", Carol appears at the end of the episode when Beth watches her get wheeled into Grady Memorial Hospital from an unknown accident. The episode "Consumed" focuses on Carol's struggle and guilt over her past demons, saying she can't stand to watch the people she loves die. They stay at an abandoned woman's shelter. They find a reanimated mother and daughter, and Carol moves to kill them but Daryl insists it is unnecessary. In the morning, Carol wakes up to find Daryl outside cremating the mother and child, and she goes out to thank him. A car marked with a white cross approaches them and as they flee, Carol is hit by one, knocking her unconscious. She is lifted in a stretcher by two officers. In the episode "Crossed", Carol remains unconscious as Beth completes her plan to give Carol epinephrine after the officers agree to turn the machines off, declaring that the resources would be wasted. Rick continues on with a rescue mission, saying he owes Carol everything. In the mid-season finale "Coda", after receiving medication, Carol is seen starting to wake up as Beth and Dawn are talking. Later, when the hostage exchange is about to take place, Carol is seen being wheeled by Beth and they hold hands as they see their group. After the exchange takes place, Beth is shot in the head by Dawn. Carol tries to comfort a distraught Daryl, telling him to put his gun down as they cry, and is helped by Tyreese to walk as they leave the hospital.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">The group journey to Washington, DC in hopes of a safe haven in "Them", set several weeks after Beth has died and several days after Tyreese's death. Carol tries to comfort a severely depressed Daryl and reassures Maggie of never giving up. In the episode "Remember", in spite of some mistrust before, the stranger Aaron (Ross Marquand) recruits Carol and the others, bringing them to his community, the Alexandria Safe-Zone. Interviewed by congresswoman and town leader Deanna Monroe (Tovah Feldshuh), Carol crafts a facade of being an inexperienced apocalyptic survivor who acted as the "den mother" to the group. She states she did laundry and gardening pre-apocalypse, and cooked for her "stupid, wonderful" husband. She expresses that she is a people person and wants to join a junior league to help others. After everyone is interviewed, she is the last to hand over her weapons to Olivia, struggling to remove her rifle and placing it in the bin, further displaying her "weakness". The next day, Carol receives her assignment as a caretaker to cook for senior citizens and busy mothers. The night after the confrontation at the town gates, Carol emerges from the house onto the porch and speaks with Daryl and Rick on the porch, discussing that they can get comfortable but not weak. In the episode "Forget", Carol is seen outside the walls, plotting with Rick and Daryl to steal guns. When a walker comes along, she empties her clip into it to give the illusion they had gone shooting. She later steals three guns before Jessie Anderson (Alexandra Breckenridge)'s son Sam (Major Dodson) spots her. She tells him that if he mentions it to his mother, "the monsters" will come for him as he is tied to a tree outside the walls, but if he is silent, she will give him cookies. The next day she gives a gun to Rick, but Daryl refuses to take one. In the episode "Spend", Carol is visited by Sam several times, who continues to ask her for more cookies. Unable to turn away, Carol starts questioning Sam and learns his father, Pete (Corey Brill)'s abusive nature. Deeply concerned for his well being, she goes to the Anderson home to try and talk to Sam or Jessie, but is coldly turned away by Pete, arousing her suspicion. When Rick returns home, Carol tells him she believes that Pete is abusing Jessie and maybe Sam, and that the only way to stop it is to kill Pete. In the season finale "Conquer", Carol pays a visit to Pete with a tuna pasta bake and asks him to check on Tara, who is still wounded. When he refuses, Carol pulls a knife on him and threatens him, saying that she can get away with claiming self-defense. Later at the town meeting, Carol is one of the people who speaks in Rick's defense. She witnesses Rick directly address the Alexandrians when he shows up with a dead walker that he had killed earlier that night, that got in on its own, and how they need to change or they will die. When Pete shows up with Michonne's katana intending to kill Rick, Carol discreetly tells him not to as Reg tries to intervene only to be killed by Pete. Carol witnesses Rick's execution of Pete under Deanna's orders and is present for Daryl and Morgan (Lennie James)'s arrival.</p>
