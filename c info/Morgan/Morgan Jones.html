							<th height="250" width="600"> Morgan Jones is a fictional character from the comic book series The Walking Dead and is portrayed by Lennie James in the American television series of the same name. In both the comics and television series, he is a devoted father struggling to get over the recent death of his wife. He and his son seek refuge in Rick's hometown (Cynthiana, Kentucky, in the comics; a small town in Georgia in the television series) after the outbreak occurs. </th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th height="50" width="600"> In the TV series Morgan is a loving and devoted father trying to keep his son Duane alive in Rick's hometown in Georgia after the apocalypse occurs and is the first survivor Rick encounters, in the pilot episode, after awakening from his coma. After saving his life from a walker Morgan tells Rick about the outbreak and they part ways with the intention of reuniting in Atlanta but the two men lose contact. In season 3 Morgan is revealed to be alive when Rick encounters him on a supply run but has become mentally unstable as Duane was killed by Morgan's undead wife, and refuses to rejoin Rick's group insisting he needs to stay and clear the town of walkers. In season 5 Morgan recovers from his mental break, the story of which is elaborated upon in season 6, and learns that Rick is in Virginia and eventually finds the Alexandria Safe-Zone and reunites with his old friend. Lennie James has received critical acclaim for his performance as Morgan, despite his very few appearances in the show. </th>

Morgan quickly comes to the realization that Rick is a living human and aids him back to health. He details Rick of the outbreak and what has been happening within the world the past couple months. Rick later supplies him and his son with guns from the Sheriff's station to ensure their protection, and departs from them to Atlanta. </th>

Morgan, unable to cope with the death of his son, resorts to locking Duane in the house with chains. As his mental health deteriorates, he begins murdering survivors who stumble by so he can feed the boy. Rick, along with his son Carl and new second-in-command Abraham, arrive back to the town with the plan to bring Morgan into the group, which he gives in to. He quickly develops an intense fixation on Carl, who reminds him of Duane. While in the group, he becomes one of the primary defenders of their campsite, and deepens his bond with Michonne, the two of them both connecting due to their damaged psyches and history of loss. At the same time, he attempts to deepen his bond with Carl after witnessing first-hand the boy's cold-blooded mentality. He believes himself to be responsible for maintaining Carl's childhood innocence and is determined to make amends for his failure to protect Duane. </th>

After he and Michonne leave the welcome party hosted by the townspeople, the two finally engage in sex. He deeply regrets his actions the following morning, believing himself to be an adulterer and continuing to cling to the memory of his deceased wife. His burdening of ill-conceived principles and refusal to let go of the past angers Michonne, despite their growing attraction towards one another. </th>
