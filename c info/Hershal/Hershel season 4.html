							<th height="250" width="600"> Approximately six months after the end of the previous season, Hershel appears in the season premiere "30 Days Without an Accident" as a member of The Council, along with Glenn, Carol, Daryl and Sasha. After his conflict with Rick in the third season, Hershel now appears much closer with Rick in his guidance as the two have become close friends. His lifestyle has drastically affected Rick's lifestyle, as Rick had relinquished leadership after the third season and has now began farming in a quieter, peaceful environment. Hershel explains to Rick about planting and growing seeds at the prison. Later, Rick tells him about his experience with Clara, a mentally unstable woman he met in the woods to which Hershel explains that she was too far gone, and that he is not, and also explains she was wrong when referring to not coming back from the drastic actions you have to take, explaining that Rick came back. </th>

						<tr>
							<th height="50" width="600"> In the episode "Infected", a deadly sickness breaks out among the prison group population and Hershel is among the people at the council examining the infected. He and the others decide to put Karen on isolation. In the episode "Isolation", Hershel is seen bandaging Rick's hand after his fight with Tyreese. He later goes into the woods with Carl to collect Herbs for the infected people. They both spot a decomposed walker as another one arrives. Once they return, Maggie tries to stop him from going inside Cell Block A to prevent him from being infected. Rick arrives and sides with Maggie, Hershel explains how they risk their lives and that he can help the sick. They both allow him to go and he goes inside and gives Caleb the herb medicine. When Caleb coughs, He spits blood into Hershel's face and Hershel himself thinks he is infected with the flu type infection. He also gives Glenn the herb medicine. </th>

							<th height="50" width="1500"> The episode "Internment" primarily focuses on Hershel as he continues to treat the ill people at the prison in Block A. Hershel, Glenn, and Sasha take care of several of the infected together until their situation spreads exponentially, which causes further problems. He attempts to reassure Dr. Caleb Subramanian that everything will be fine, before realizing that the doctor had given up hope, showing Hershel several guns he had packed and revealing blood running from his eyes and mouth. Later, Hershel revives a passed out Sasha, as she refers to him as a hero. When he exits the cell, Lizzie Samuels yells to Hershel, alerting him of 2 walkers in the room. Hershel gets pinned but a woman and man come to save him. However, the man's teenage son turns and bites his father, causing him to accidentally shoot and kill the woman. Hershel quickly runs to Lizzie who is pinned under a walker, and throws it onto a fence below the catwalk. Hershel then shouts at Caleb for a gun, before encountering the doctor, now dead and reanimated. After stabbing him through the bars of the cell, he retrieves a shotgun, which he uses to lure and kill the walkers. Right after, Hershel goes to get the breathing tube from the walker to save Glenn, but is pinned. Maggie, after hearing the gunfire from outside the prison, finally breaks into the cell block, and kills the walker and saves Hershel. She kills the remaining walkers and then they go to save Glenn, which they do. Afterwards, Hershel is seen back in Caleb's cell, where he tends to his corpse and attempts to read his bible before breaking down and sobbing over the events of the day. The next day, Hershel is confronted by Daryl, who asks where Carol is. Hershel, however, reassured him that she is fine, but directs him to Rick, as Hershel is aware of Carol's exile over the death of Karen, an infected survivor. He then rides with Michonne to burn and bury the corpses from the previous day. </th>

							<th height="50" width="1500"> In "Dead Weight", Hershel and Michonne are discovered by The Governor, who has returned with people from Caesar Martinez's camp, to successfully take over the prison after the massacre from the previous season, which caused him to be fail and start over. In the mid-season finale "Too Far Gone", The Governor ambushes Hershel and Michonne, knocking Michonne unconscious, as he forces Hershel to drop his gun. While they are held hostage, The Governor explains that he intends to take the prison from Rick so that his new group can live there safely, and will be using Hershel and Michonne to get it. Hershel tries, but fails to persuade The Governor that they could all live together. When The Governor states that he will kill members of Rick's group if necessary, Hershel states that The Governor should realize that threatening to kill a man's children is wrong since he used to have a child himself, but The Governor has already made his decision. </th>

						<tr>
							<th height="50" width="1500"> Once The Governor arrives at the Prison with his group and the two hostages, Hershel attempts to help Rick in reaching diplomacy. Rick spends several minutes pleading with The Governor, asking him to let Hershel and Michonne go and offering to let his group live in the Prison with the others. The Governor becomes irritated and holds Michonne's katana to Hershel's throat. Rick then looks down at Hershel and Hershel nods his head, as a sign of saying Rick has made the right choice. Rick frantically tries to reason, and reinstates Hershel's virtues of peace and that nobody is "too far gone", and that "we can all come back," leading Hershel to smile vaguely. The Governor begins to put down the sword, but then stops, muttering "liar". The Governor then swings the sword into Hershel's neck, partially decapitating him. This leads to the beginning of a massive gunfight, as Maggie and Beth watch their father's murder in horror from the prison gates, as they participate and then help the others escape as well as themselves. As Hershel bleeds out and desperately attempts to crawl away in the ensuing gunfight, The Governor catches up to him and repeatedly slashes at Hershel's neck with the sword until he decapitates him. In the episode "After", his reanimated head is discovered later by Michonne after the attack and she remorsefully stabs it with her katana. </th>

							<th height="50" width="1500"> In the season finale "A," Hershel appears several times throughout the episode in flashbacks. Hershel convinces Rick into pulling himself from the violence, and to gather animals to domesticate and grow crops in the plots of land. Rick later convinces his son Carl to do the same. His role in the episode is to show Rick's contrasting lifestyles of being a brutalized and uncompromising survivor and later returning leadership role to his previous relinquished leadership role between seasons three and four, much to the influence of Hershel. Hershel explains to Rick as they farm and laugh with Beth, as he jokingly refers to her as the new sheriff in the town that "it can be like this all the time". He is also shown hugging his daughter, Maggie and greeting Glenn after they return from a supply run. </th>
