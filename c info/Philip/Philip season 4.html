							<th height="250" width="600"> In season four, Michonne has been actively hunting the Governor, but is failing in her endeavor and intends to continue her search into Macon, but Daryl and Tyreese talk her out of it and she ceases her hunt. The Governor does not appear in this season until the fifth episode "Internment", during which he is very briefly shown hiding just outside the prison. </th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th height="50" width="600"> The following episode "Live Bait" reveals that, just after massacring his own people, the Governor sets up camp with Martinez and Shumpert. When he does not try to stop a walker from killing him, Martinez shoots it and, believing the Governor to be broken, he and Shumpert abandon him. The next day the Governor drives back to Woodbury, which is overrun with walkers, and burns down the entire town. After several months alone intentionally trying to let the walkers kill him, he finally collapses on the street. He looks up to see a young girl, about the same age as Penny, in the window of a nearby apartment building; he pulls himself back to his feet and investigates. He finds the Chambler family residing inside, consisting of sisters Lilly and Tara, their father David, and Lilly's daughter Meghan. Lilly and Tara initially hold the Governor at gunpoint, but they later confiscate his pistol and allow him to stay in an apartment across the hallway. After hearing about how the Governor has survived the last few months, they ask him his name. He tells them that it is "Brian Heriot", a name he saw painted on the side of a barn while staggering aimlessly through the countryside. Lilly later comes to the apartment where he is staying and offers him some food; he accepts it, but after she leaves, he throws the food out of the window and continues eating a can of tuna he found. He goes to their apartment to return the plate and is invited inside. He runs some errands for the family, such as getting the backgammon set that one of David's old war friends had in his apartment on the floor above them, since playing backgammon is the only thing that makes Meghan happy. Brian finds the backgammon set and a few rounds of ammo in the apartment. He kills David's reanimated friend and takes a revolver. He returns to the Chamblers' apartment, gives David the backgammon set, and leaves. Lilly asks Brian to get some oxygen tanks for David, who has cancer and whose last tank is running out of oxygen. After several struggles with walkers at a nearby nursing home, Brian is able to escape with two oxygen tanks. Lilly thanks him and cleans a minor head wound that he received. She lets Meghan stay and watch him while she goes back to their apartment; Meghan asks him how he got his eyepatch, and he tells her that he was trying to help someone he cared for, but lies about the circumstances and leaves out that he was trying to kill Michonne. Later, he is teaching Meghan how to play chess when Lilly reveals that David has died. Brian tells the family to leave David's room, as he knows that David is about to reanimate, but Lilly wants another minute alone to say goodbye. David turns and nearly bites Tara, but Brian is able to save them by bashing in David's head with one of the oxygen tanks. After he buries David, he burns his photo of his wife and Penny. That night, he goes to the Chamblers to say goodbye, but Lilly insists that he stay. Brian says they cannot go with him, but Lilly says he has become a part of their family. Brian and Lilly become lovers, and Brian saves Meghan when she falls into a pit of walkers, killing them with his bare hands. Gunfire can be heard in the background, but it stops soon after Brian kills the walkers. He hugs Meghan and promises that he will keep her safe from anything that may harm her. He hears a surprised voice coming from outside the pit. He looks up and sees Martinez standing above him. </th>

							<th height="50" width="600"> In the episode "Dead Weight", Martinez takes in the Governor, accepting his new facade as "Brian", and the girls and lets them join their camp. Among the camp are brothers Pete and Mitch Dolgen, who have a working tank. While scouting for supplies the four find walker bodies cut up with the words "liar", "murderer" and "rapist" written on them, the last one with a photo of a family resembling the Governor's, greatly implied to be a warning from Michonne. When it becomes clear that Martinez may not be able to keep them safe and offers to share power with Brian, Brian kills him by throwing him into a pit of zombies. Pete takes command, and Brian later kills him as well after he displays an inability to kill a group of other survivors to take their belongings. Brian tells Mitch who, though angry that Brian murdered his brother, understands why after Brian explains his plan to find a sanctuary. Brian plans to rally the camp and use the tank in a second attack on the prison. In the ending scene when scouting the prison he sees Michonne and Hershel, and prepares to shoot them. In the mid-season finale "Too Far Gone", Brian instead takes Hershel and Michonne hostage and informs the camp of his plan to take the prison. He says Rick's group destroyed Woodbury and killed Penny, and that they are murderers and thieves but that there are good people among them, and tells his camp that he plans to use Hershel and Michonne as leverage to force Rick's group out of the prison without killing anyone. Michonne vows to kill Brian, while Hershel tries to reason with him but Brian becomes angered when Hershel calls him "Governor", warning him not to use that name again. Upon arriving at the prison with his army and tank, Brian tells Rick that he is going to give their group a chance to leave without anyone getting killed. Rick tries to plead with Brian, stating that they can co-exist peacefully, but Brian calls him a liar and executes Hershel as a fire-fight ensures. Lilly, with Meghan's corpse in her arms, arrives in time to see him murder Hershel. Brian dispassionately shoots Meghan to prevent reanimation before ordering his people to kill everyone in the prison. Brian uses the tank to roll over the fences and goes into the fight himself, only to be tackled by Rick. The two of them fight, and Brian eventually pins Rick and brutally beats him before beginning to choke him to death. Before he can finish him, Brian is stabbed through the back by Michonne, who decides to leave him to bleed to death. Towards the end of the episode, a dying and barely-conscious Brian is shot in the head by Lilly. In the opening of the next episode "After", his corpse is seen lying on the ground, with both legs torn off, his chest ripped into, and a bullet hole in his forehead. </th>
