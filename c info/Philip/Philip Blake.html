							<th height="250" width="600"> The Governor (real name Philip Blake in the comics/novels and Philip Blake in the TV series) is a fictional character from the comic book series The Walking Dead, and is portrayed by David Morrissey in the television series of the same name. Created by Robert Kirkman and artists Charlie Adlard and Cliff Rathburn, the character made his debut in The Walking Dead #27 in April 2006. A primary antagonist of both series, the Governor is the seemingly charismatic leader of Woodbury, Georgia, who is revealed to be a brutal, insane leader that comes into conflict with protagonist Rick Grimes. The Governor is responsible for several deaths of primary characters in both forms of media. The character's origins are explored in the novel The Walking Dead: Rise of the Governor, which was written by Kirkman and Jay Bonansinga. </th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th height="50" width="600"> In the television series, the Governor first appears in the show's third season. As with his comic adaptation, he is the leader of Woodbury; however, his disturbing motives are reflected in his authoritarian ways in dealing with threats to his community primarily by executing most large groups and only accepting lone survivors into his community. His dark nature escalates when he comes into conflict with Rick Grimes and his group occupying the nearby prison, whom he vows to eliminate, leaving several key characters dead both in Rick's group and his own and also has a relationship with Andrea. In the series' fourth season, he becomes alarmed by his cold ways and attempts to redeem himself upon meeting a new family, using the name Brian Heriot, although he reverts to his old persona to ensure the family's survival which leads to several more characters dead and forcing Rick and his family to abandon the prison. </th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th height="50" width="600"> In 2009, the Governor was ranked as IGN's 86th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time, and was ranked #28 on TV Guide's list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time. For his performance as the Governor, Morrissey was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the 39th Saturn Awards. </th>

							<th height="50" width="400"> Following Woodbury's capture and murder of stranded refugees from Atlanta, the Governor is met by Rick Grimes and his band of survivors when they explore the town. After initially acting hospitable, the Governor turns on the group. Attempting to find the location of Rick's prison refuge in order to collect supplies for Woodbury, he proceeds to cut off Rick's hand, mentally tortures Glenn, and has Michonne restrained, stripped and repeatedly raped. To learn the location of the prison, the Governor allows the survivors to escape the premises with the help of one of his guards, Caesar Martinez. However, Michonne stays behind and finds her way to his apartment, where she brutally tortures him. He loses his right arm, his fingernails, his penis, and his left eye. When Michonne rejoins the group and they ask her if the Governor is still alive, Michonne is uncertain. </th>

							<th height="50" width="600"> The Governor survives with the help of Bob Stookey, a citizen who had medical experience, and is eventually able to find the prison. The Governor uses the murder of Martinez by Rick to rally the townspeople against the prison's inhabitants. Things do not go according to plan, as Rick's group puts up a tenacious defense that leads to a humiliating retreat. After a failed attempt to gain his way into the prison by use of Tyreese as a hostage and Tyreese's subsequent decapitation with Michonne's katana, the Governor crushes the fences with a tank. A bloody massacre ensues, leading to a high death toll and ultimately making the prison less secure and less habitable. </th>

					<table align="center">					
						<tr>
							<th height="50" width="600"> Tensions steadily rise within the Governor's group, as the ammunition they have remaining is limited and a handful of their own moral consciences come into play, especially when killing defenseless or young members of the opposing group. Both factors result in the remnants of his army turning on him, Lilly killing him, throwing his corpse to the zombies, and making a last-ditch attempt to fortify the prison. </th>
