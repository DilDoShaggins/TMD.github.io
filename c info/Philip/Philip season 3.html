							<th height="250" width="600"> The Governor first appears in "Walk with Me", the third episode of season three, having forcibly taken Andrea and Michonne from the woods after Merle discovers them near a downed military helicopter. Woodbury, under his rule, is a community that thinks of him as a kind and caring leader. He murders the surviving soldier, Lt. Welles, after Welles tells him where the rest of his squad is. When the Governor arrives at the squad's encampment, he and his men kill them all and take their supplies. In the episode "Killer Within", the Governor works on convincing Andrea and Michonne to stay in Woodbury, although Michonne notices bullet holes and bloodstains on the National Guard vehicles, which increases her suspicions. He is more successful at befriending Andrea, and he reveals some of his past to her, including his real name. In the episode "Say the Word", it is shown that the Governor has a zombified daughter named Penny, whom he keeps hidden, feeds body parts to, and grooms affectionately while playing the lullaby Bye, Baby Bunting. Michonne uncovers clues that indicate he is mentally disturbed, including a notebook that begins as a sort of urban planning diary that devolves into lists of names followed by pages of tally marks. He allows Michonne to leave town, but she is unable to convince Andrea to leave with her. The Governor leads Andrea to a gathering for the townsfolk: a sparring match between Merle and Martinez surrounded by chained, toothless walkers. The spectacle shocks Andrea, who describes it as "barbaric", but the Governor insists it is "fun" and teaches the residents to not be afraid. In the episode "Hounded", Andrea confesses to the Governor that she did enjoy the fights of the previous evening, and he and Andrea begin a sexual relationship. He sends Merle to find and kill Michonne, and although Merle fails to kill her, he returns with two captives, Glenn and Maggie. Merle lies to the Governor and claims that Michonne was killed. In the episode "When the Dead Come Knocking", the Governor conceals his activities from Andrea while he interrogates Maggie and Glenn. When he threatens to shoot Glenn, Maggie gives him the information about the prison and their group. In the mid-season finale "Made to Suffer", during Rick's foray into Woodbury to rescue Glenn and Maggie, Michonne kills Penny, the Governor attacks Michonne, and in self-defense she stabs him in the hand and the right eye with a glass shard. Realizing that Merle lied to him about Michonne, the Governor calls a town meeting, where he claims the town has been attacked by terrorists brought by Merle and he brings forth a captured Daryl, reuniting the brothers. The Governor orders them to fight to the death, and the town calls for their blood, as a shocked Andrea looks on. </th>

							<th height="50" width="600"> In the mid-season premiere "The Suicide King", the fight between Merle and Daryl is broken up when the prison group attacks, allowing the brothers to escape while the Governor looks on. The Governor withdraws to his apartment as the town is in unrest after the attack. Andrea confronts him about her friends' presence in town, and then goes out to calm and inspire the townspeople. In the episode "Home", the Governor asks Milton where his loyalties lie, and asks him to keep tabs on Andrea. The Governor and his men then attack the prison, as Rick Grimes's group runs for cover and gunfire erupts on both sides. A bread truck crashes through the prison's inner and outer gates and stops in the yard. The Governor smiles as the back door opens and walkers stream out. The Governor gleefully sprays machine gun fire in the air and then drives off as the survivors struggle with the walkers. In the episode "I Ain't a Judas", the Governor proceeds to rally Woodbury against the prison survivors, labeling them terrorists and raiders. Andrea wants to leave to negotiate peace with the prison, but the Governor discourages her, implying that she will not be welcomed back if she leaves. When Milton tells the Governor that Andrea asked him to help her sneak out, the Governor tells him to go with her. The Governor welcomes Tyreese, Sasha, Allen and Ben to Woodbury, after Rick kicked them out of the prison, and they volunteer to help out around Woodbury with whatever is needed, supplying him with a layout of the prison. Andrea returns to Woodbury and is allowed back in, where she warily resumes her place at the Governor's side. In the episode "Arrow on the Doorpost", encouraged by Andrea, the Governor meets with Rick in a secluded area to offer him peace in exchange for Michonne, giving him two days to think about it. The Governor returns to Woodbury and secretly orders Martinez to set an ambush at the barn, to kill all of Rick's group and bring Michonne to Woodbury so he can torture her. In the episode "Prey", Milton tries to talk the Governor out of killing the prison group, and when this fails Milton reveals the Governor's plans and his dark, sadistic, duplicitous nature to Andrea. Andrea flees for the prison, and the Governor hunts her down personally, bringing her back to Woodbury and strapping her in the dentist's chair that he meant to use on Michonne. In the episode "This Sorrowful Life", Merle kidnaps Michonne at Rick's suggestion to turn her over to the Governor, but lets her go and instead lures walkers to the Governor's meeting place to ambush the Woodbury army. After Merle shoots at them as they're distracted and kills eight of the Governor's men, both directly and caused, then the Governor shoots and kills Merle, leaving his body to reanimate as a walker, which is later killed by Daryl. In the season final "Welcome to the Tombs", the Governor brutally beats up Milton after learning that he burned the walkers which allowed Merle's ambush to happen and then shows him Andrea tied up and orders him to kill her. Instead Milton tries in vain to kill him only for the Governor to stab him numerous times and leaves him to bleed out, locked the door behind him, which causes Milton to reanimate and cause Andrea's death. He then leads his army into the prison to kill Rick's entire group, the exception of Tyreese and Sasha who wants nothing to do with it, but Rick and the others have set a trap, expecting his arrival. Ambushed and outgunned by a prepared Maggie and Glenn in riot gear, the Governor's army flees the prison in terror. The Governor stops the fast-fleeing convoy, and, in response to their protests against returning to the prison, he opens fire and slaughters them all, sparing only Martinez and Shumpert, his two best henchmen. Only Karen escapes his rampage by playing dead under a corpse. The Governor, Martinez, and Shumpert are last seen driving off as Rick and Tyreese bring everyone from Woodbury to the prison and leave Woodbury to be overrun. </th>
