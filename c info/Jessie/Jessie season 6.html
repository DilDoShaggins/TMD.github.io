							<th height="50" width="600"> In the season premiere, "First Time Again", Jessie first appears in a flashback. She is first seen hugging a devastated Sam at their home when Ron walks out. In Rick's meeting with the Alexandrians, Jessie listens into the plan with bruises on her face. Later, Jessie is in the armory when Rick walks in. Jessie advises that they should stay away from each other for some time due to the fact he killed her husband, Pete. Jessie admonishes Rick for his behavior with Ron in the woods despite the fact that Rick saved him from certain death. Rick understands this and tells Jessie that things are going to get worse and that she needs to know how to use a gun. Rick says he could teach her but Jessie turns him down and says that she already asked Rosita to help teach her. In the episode "JSS", Jessie tries to give Ron a haircut, but he storms out with attitude and refuses as Rick, who is her friend, killed his father. When The Wolves attack Alexandria, Jessie hides with Sam in a closet, but goes downstairs to warn Ron away from the house as she knows there is a Wolf inside, armed with a gun. A Wolf sneaks up behind her and slams her to the floor. The Wolf goes to pick up Jessie's gun that she threw away when she was attacked. Jessie arises from the ground and picks up some scissors from her stylist set and runs towards the Wolf when her back is turned. Jessie repeatedly stabs the Wolf in the chest violently. Ron walks in and watches her as Jessie kills the Wolf. Jessie then stabs the Wolf's brain to prevent reanimation. In the episode "Now", Jessie listens to Rick's speech after he is chased by a super-pack of walkers to the gates of Alexandria and now the community is surrounded by walkers. She goes home and removes the dead Wolf from her kitchen. Later, Jessie kills a zombified Betsy after she commits suicide after her husband's death. She tells the community, who watch in horror at the killing of Betsy's zombified self, that they have to fight or they will die. She later tries to strengthen Sam who is left greatly affected by the previous attack. At the end of the episode, Jessie asks Rick if there will be a future and he then passionately kisses her. In the episode "Heads Up", Jessie is at Rosita Espinosa's weapon training class learning how to use a machete properly. She is later seen in her home when Carol Peletier asks if she can take care of Judith Grimes. In the mid-season finale, "Start to Finish", Jessie helps Rick, an injured Deanna, Carl, Michonne, Gabriel, and Ron into her house after Alexandria is swarmed with walkers. She urgently pushes against the walkers that are trying to push into her house along with the others. She gives Sam guidance on how to keep strong. Pushing the walkers out downstairs, there seem to be too many and they begin entering the house. They all rush upstairs and formulate a plan to escape. They cover themselves in walker blood and guts and start walking through the herd, holding hands. Sam gets scared and calls for Jessie multiple times. </th>

							<th height="50" width="600"> In the mid-season premiere, "No Way Out", Jessie is seen walking through the herd with Rick and the others. They stop and discuss an adapted plan to leave Alexandria. Jessie attempts to get Sam to go with Gabriel and Judith to the church for safety, but he refuses. Walking through the night, Sam begins to panic when he sees a young boy walker. He starts making noise and Jessie, Ron, and Rick desperately try to calm him down, but he is grabbed and devoured by walkers. Jessie breaks down in tears, still holding onto Sam's hand. As Jessie screams at the sight of Sam being devoured, Carl, Ron, and Rick tell her that they must leave to avoid discovery by the walkers, however, she doesn't take any notice, leading the walkers to devour her, unfazed as they rip into her. This causes Ron distress. While Jessie is being eaten, Carl attempts to escape, but is unable due to her tight grip on his hand. After some hesitation, Rick chops off her hand with his hatchet to save Carl from being pulled in after her. </th>
