							<th height="50" width="600"> In the episode "Remember", Jessie appears as a member of the Alexandria Safe-Zone who gives supplies to newcomer Rick Grimes, who recently shaved his long beard and Jessie offers to give him a haircut which surprises Rick as Jessie knows nothing of him. Rick confesses that he never expected to see electricity, showers or decent people ever again which Jessie understands and offers to introduce her son Ron to Rick's son Carl to help him adjust also which Rick approves. Later when the group explores the neighborhood Rick loses sight of Carl and Judith and runs into Jessie who shows a panicking Rick that they are just talking to some elderly residents. Jessie also sees Glenn Rhee and Aiden Monroe come to blows until Deanna, Aiden's mother, separates them. In the episode "Forget", Jessie, Pete, Ron, and Sam attend Deanna's party. She speaks with Rick, whom she is getting along very well with, and he later kisses her on the cheek, to which she awkwardly leaves. In the episode "Spend", Jessie's sculpture has been destroyed, and Rick tells her that he will find whoever broke it. Later, it is suggested by Carol, that Jessie's husband Pete, has been hitting her and Sam. </th>

							<th height="50" width="600"> In the episode "Try", Jessie is in her garage when Rick shows up, informing her that he knows her family's secret. She tells him that she is a grown, married woman who can take care of herself. Jessie closes the garage door on Rick. Jessie appears to be crying about her problems, when Rick walks through her door, demanding that she will let him take care of her. She asks him if he would do this for anyone else, and her replies that he wouldn't. She then gives him permission to help her. Pete walks through the back door drunk. He demands Rick to leave, but Jessie stands up for herself by telling him softly to leave. "Just go", she tells both Pete and Rick. Pete punches Rick, which leads to them having a fight in their house, and then in the street after they blast through the window, brawling. Jessie attempts to get Pete off of Rick, but Pete pushes her away violently. As the two are separated, Jessie is shown sulking. In the season finale "Conquer", Rick approaches Jessie, who is sorting out her broken window due to the fight. She tells him that it is probably best if they both stay away from each other, but also tells him that she thinks he was doing the right thing, and ultimately thanks him for standing up for her. At the end of the episode, Jessie is among the crowd discussing the fight and she is the sole Alexandrian to speak up for Rick. When Pete turns up drunk, ready to assassinate Rick, he accidentally slits Reg's throat while trying to stop him. Jessie is horrified and shocked by this. She appears to be briefly concerned about what will now happen to Pete. After Pete is executed by Rick under Deanna's orders, Jessie isn't seen, but she is among those who react. </th>
