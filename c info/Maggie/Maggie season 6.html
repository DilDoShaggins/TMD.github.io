							<th height="250" width="600"> In the season premiere, "First Time Again", Maggie is seen walking in to check on Tara, who has woken up and in bed. Maggie then tends to Glenn, who is bloody and recovering from when Nicholas attempted to murder him. Maggie is among the group of people deciding on what to do with the walkers that are in the rock quarry. She wants to help, but Glenn tells her she should stay at the Safe Zone and help keep order with Deanna. While building a makeshift barrier outside of the Safe Zone, Maggie speaks to Tara and reveals that Nicholas tried to kill Glenn. She says they must not tell a lot of people, as Glenn doesn't want Nicholas to be exiled. In the episode "JSS", she helps keep Deanna safe outside of the walls while the Wolves are slaughtering the residents inside. Once all of the wolves have escaped or been killed, Maggie goes back inside Alexandria and tells Deanna she needs to remain strong. In the episode "Now", Maggie learns about the disappearance of Glenn. Maggie goes into the gun room and attempts to find Glenn on her own, when Aaron catches her. The two decide to take the sewer tunnel underneath Alexandria, since the walls are now surrounded by hundreds of walkers that followed Rick back. Once in the sewer, Maggie breaks down and reveals that she is pregnant. She and Aaron then head back to the safe zone, with hopes that Glenn will make his way back to Alexandria. In the episode "Heads Up", Maggie is standing on lookout post to watch for any signs for Glenn. rick approaches her and comforts her, saying that the group ha been through worse out there and that the people missing will return. In which Maggie and Rick begin to talk about how Judith is beginning to look like Lori. Short afterwards, Maggie sees green balloons in the air and yells out that it's Glenn. She then watches as the watch tower suddenly collapses on the Alexandria wall and the herd begins to make their way into the safe zone. In the mid-season finale "Start to Finish", Maggie runs up a near by lookout post to avoid the herd of walkers that have now swarmed the streets of Alexandria. She is later spotted by Glenn and Enid as she stands stranded with no where to go. In the mid-season premiere "No Way Out", Enid and Glenn save Maggie from the lookout post and joins the others in fighting the herd inside Alexandria. The next morning Maggie is seen inside getting bandages for her leg. 2 months later, In "The Next World" Maggie walks up to Enid and tells her that if she ever needs to talk to somebody then she'll be there. In "Knots Untie", Maggie is first seen talking to Glenn in the garden who then see Abraham running into Rick's house. They follow and find Jesus with everyone pointing their guns at him. Maggie goes to the meeting where Jesus reveals that he comes from another community and that he wants to offer a trade deal with Alexandria. Maggie is among the people in Rick's group who go to the Hilltop. While there, Rick asks Maggie to speak to the Hilltop's leader, Gregory, and to make a deal. At first Gregory dismisses Maggie's deal, saying that he doesn't believe Alexandria has much to offer. After Gregory is almost assassinated by a Hilltop member who says he had to save his brother, Jesus tells Maggie and the others that a man named Negan and the Saviors have been terrorizing the Hilltop. Maggie then goes to speak to Gregory and prompts a deal saying that if the Hilltop gives Alexandria food, then Rick's group will take care of Negan, which Gregory agrees to. Maggie then talks to Rick and the others about the deal and they all agree with it, saying they believe they can stop Negan. Before Rick's group leaves, Maggie receives an ultrasound. On the ride back to Alexandria, Maggie and the others look at the photo of her unborn baby. </th>
