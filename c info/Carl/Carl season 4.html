          <p height="10" width="250">In the season premiere "30 Days Without an Accident", Carl has turned to farming along with his father, Rick tries to encourage Carl to be a kid, but Carl hardened by what he's seen and done is reluctant to do so. He does go to "Storytime" that is hosted by Carol which included teaching the kids how to use weapons when needed. In the episode "Infected", Carl tells his father about Carol training the children with knives. After an infection breaks out in the prison Rick lets him carry a gun again. In the episode "Isolation", Carl helps Hershel pick elderberries, which Hershel will use to make a tea for the sick. In the episode "Internment", Carl helps Rick reinforce the fences, but when walkers break through anyway, Rick and Carl arm themselves with assault rifles and gun them down. In the episode "Dead Weight", the Governor secretly watches Rick and Carl digging in the prison yard. In the mid season finale "Too Far Gone", Carl tells Daryl he has a clear shot on The Governor, but Daryl tells him to not take the shot as a firefight would break out. During the fight he saves his injured father before finding his sister's carrier empty and bloody. Devastated, Rick and Carl leave the prison as walkers invade with Rick telling Carl, "Don't look back."</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">In the mid-season premiere "After", Rick and Carl found a house in a neighborhood. Carl feels like he doesn't need Rick anymore and while Rick lays unconscious Carl starts scolding him about how he wanted to plant vegetables and hide while The Governor knew where they were. He goes on to state that he never forgot how to survive while it happened. He is later seen luring two walkers away from the house to kill them somewhere where noise won't attract other walkers. He successfully lures them away but encounters a third walker and nearly gets killed. He goes to a house and discovers another walker in one of the rooms. The walker nearly kills him but Carl gets away losing his shoe in the process. He eats pudding he found in the house while sitting on the roof. He later returns to the house and Rick rises from a couch being used to block the door from walkers. Thinking that Rick is dead, Carl raises his gun at Rick, only to cry saying that he is scared. The next day, as they are sitting near the couch, they hear a knock on the door. It is revealed to be Michonne after she found the pudding that Carl ate the day before. Rick looks at the door and says it's for Carl. In the episode "Claimed", while Rick stays back at the house to recover, Carl and Michonne set out on a supply run where they further their bond, and Carl learns that Michonne once mothered a son. They return from their supply run to find Rick fleeing the house due to it becoming occupied by a hostile group of men. Carl accompanies Rick and Michonne on foot until they come by a train car with a sign attached which points out a sanctuary known as Terminus. In the episode "Us", Rick, Michonne, and Carl travel along the train tracks towards Terminus, unaware that they are being tracked.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">In the season finale "A", on the way to Terminus, they are confronted by the hostile group who now have Daryl in their employ. Daryl retaliates against the hostile group, and the confrontation quickly escalates. During the ensuing fight, a man attempts to rape Carl, but is stopped and killed by Rick. Carl, Rick, Daryl and Michonne continue to follow the tracks, eventually reaching Terminus. Rick decides to have his group sneak into the compound to avoid detection, remaining cautious of its current residents. They find the Terminus members in a broadcasting room, and are greeted by Gareth, the apparent leader. Gareth escorts Rick's group to the courtyard where other Terminus members are situated. Rick notices a Terminus resident in possession of Glenn's watch and quickly deduces that something is wrong. He draws his weapon and demands to know where Glenn and the other people from the prison are. Gareth has his men open fire on Rick's group and strategically rounds them up to a train car. Rick, Carl, Michonne and Daryl are forced to drop their weapons and step into the train car where they are held prisoner. Inside, they are reunited with prison group survivors â€“ Glenn, Maggie, Bob and Sasha, along with new group members Tara, Abraham, Eugene and Rosita.</p>
