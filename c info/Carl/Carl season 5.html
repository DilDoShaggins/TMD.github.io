          <p height="10" width="250">In the season premiere "No Sanctuary", Carl remains in the train car until his father releases him and he helps the group escape Terminus. Afterward they are reunited with Carol and Tyreese, who also saved Judith, whom Carl and his father are overjoyed to see alive. In the episode "Strangers", Carl insists they help a priest named Gabriel while Rick is willing to let him die but everyone in the group is suspicious of how normal he seems as he takes them to the church. Before leaving on a run Rick insists Gabriel can't be trusted, at least not yet, and tells him to not let his guard down. Carl also finds claw marks on the walls and the words "you'll burn for this". In the episode "Four Walls and a Roof", when Rick and a few others leave to ambush Gareth, Carl stays behind to protect Gabriel, Eugene, a dying Bob and Judith along with Rosita and Tyreese. After Gareth's death he remains at the church whilst Abraham takes half the group to start heading towards Washington DC. In the episode "Crossed", Rick takes another group to rescue Beth. Carl, Michonne, Judith and Gabriel remain in the fortified church to wait while Carl tries to convince Gabriel that if he's with their group he needs to defend himself and gives him a blade. In the mid-season finale "Coda", when Gabriel leaves the church then brings walkers back to it, Carl helps fight before taking Judith and escaping under the floors of the church. He and Michonne then lock the walkers inside the church. When Abraham returns they all head to Atlanta to regroup with Rick. He remains in the truck whilst the rest head into the hospital to find Beth, discovering her dead.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">In the mid-season premiere "What Happened and What's Going On", Carl is present for Tyreese's funeral. In the episode "Them", the group continues their trip to Washington D.C. and Carl tries to cheer up Maggie, still grief-stricken by Beth's death, a music box and the group finds themselves in a barn during a storm as a herd of walkers tries to get in and Carl helps keep the door shut until the storm kills the walkers. In the episode "The Distance", Maggie and Sasha bring a stranger, Aaron, back to the barn who claims to be part of a community and wants them to join but Rick is distrusting of him whilst Carl, Michonne, Maggie and Sasha aren't. When Rick expresses uncertainty of taking up Aaron's offer Carl immediately protests against his father and wants to go and eventually they arrive at his community, the Alexandria Safe-Zone. In the episode "Remember", each group member is interviewed by Alexandria's leader Deanna Monroe and Carl tells her that he was the one to kill his mother but believes she would be happy to see that he and Rick have found the place Lori had wanted them to find. Carl is also introduced to Ron, Jessie's teenage son, who introduces him to Mikey and Enid, a young girl Carl seems to like, but also hearing them talk of video games and schools which stuns Carl who hasn't heard those words for years. Though Carl does like them he also believes they are weak from inexperience and becomes worried that being in Alexandria will make him weak also. Later Carl spots Enid climbing the wall with a bag of supplies and follows her to investigate but she mysteriously vanishes as he also finds his father engaging some walkers, but is almost killed because of self-doubt because of Carl's earlier concern and Carl saves him. Carl and Rick return in time to break up Glenn and Aiden, Deanna's son, fighting each other and Carl sees Enid return but she just ignores him and walks off. In the episode "Forget", Carl begins to adjust to Alexandria and is now friends with Ron and Mikey whom he is seen talking to at the house welcoming party in Deanna's home. In the episode "Try", Carl sneaks out after Enid again and she tells him to stop following her. He tries to convince her that it is dangerous outside the walls, but she believes they are meant to be outside and provokes a walker to chase them which Carl actually enjoys. Carl tries to learn why he creeps Enid out but she simply states that he just does. As they are sitting down Carl tries to learn more about her life before Alexandria, admitting that things happened to him, but she does not want to talk about it. They soon hear walkers nearby and take shelter in a hollowed-out tree. As the walkers are walking by Enid states that the world is theirs now and humans just live in it, and as they gaze into each other's eyes Carl holds Enid's hand but quickly pulls away and Enid teases him saying that he is scared of her too. Carl and Enid return later to see Rick attacking Pete. Carl tries to stop him but Rick shoves him away and Carl watches as Rick begins scolding Deanna and the other Alexandrians for believing they are safe, until Michonne knocks him out. In the season finale "Conquer", Carl appears when Rick shows up at the house to check on Carl. Carl asks his dad what his plan is, but Rick instead tells Carl to stay at home. Carl asks if this was "home", to which Rick answers "yes". Later Carl appears at the house holding Judith listening to the music box he gave to Maggie to help her grieve over Beth's death.</p>
