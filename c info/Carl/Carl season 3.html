          <p height="10" width="250">In the season premiere "Seed", six to seven months later, Carl has evolved into a child soldier of sorts; he has grown more proficient with weapons, and has adapted a more mature demeanor, as well as a more responsible role within the group. Carl is with the group as they setting into an abandoned prison. He has grown distant from Lori and shows a developing crush on Hershel's seventeen-year-old daughter, Beth. In the episode "Sick", Carl sneaks off alone to find the prison infirmary, brings back much-needed medical supplies, but Lori scolds him for going off alone. In the episode "Killer Within", after watching his mother die while giving birth via C-section, a distraught Carl shoots her per her request to prevent reanimation. In the episode "Say the Word", Carl watches as Rick storms off to find Lori's body. In the episode "Hounded", Carl, Daryl, and Oscar find Carol, who had been missing and presumed dead from an earlier walker attack. In the episode "When the Dead Come Knocking", Rick lets Carl name his new sister, and he names her Judith after one of his school teachers. While Rick, Oscar, Daryl and Michonne head out to attack Woodbury, Carl is left in charge of protecting the others inside of the prison. In the mid-season finale "Made to Suffer", upon the arrival of Tyreese's group, Carl takes the initiative to lock them all out of his cell block.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">In the mid-season premiere "The Suicide King", Carl keeps Tyreese, Sasha, Allen, and Ben locked up, and when Rick returns he yells at them to get out of the prison. In the episode "Home", Carl and Glenn investigate the breach where Tyreese's group got into the prison, and report back to the group that the boiler room is overrun with walkers. In the episode "I Ain't a Judas", Carl tells Rick to take a break from being the leader, as the stress has been too much for his father. In the episode "Clear", Rick, Carl, and Michonne make a run to Rick and Carl's home town, where they encounter Morgan Jones, and Carl bonds with Michonne. In the episode "Arrow on the Doorpost", Carl helps Glenn and the rest of the group organize their arsenal. In the episode "This Sorrowful Life", Carl helps Maggie create a diversion to distract walkers at the fence. In the season finale "Welcome to the Tombs", Carl kills a teenage member of The Governor's army, who failed to drop his gun, despite professing to surrender, when the boy stepped closer to Carl, Hershel (who was unarmed), and infant Judith. Carl tells Rick he did not want to take his chances by letting someone else live who could potentially kill someone in their group; he brings up how he did not kill the walker on the farm that killed Dale and how Rick's decision to not kill Andrew and The Governor resulted in the deaths of Lori and Merle, respectively. Carl also appears angered by Rick's decision to take in Woodbury's remaining survivors, who generally appear to be less able-bodied.</p>
