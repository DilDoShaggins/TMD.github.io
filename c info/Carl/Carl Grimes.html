          <p height="10" width="250">Carl Grimes is a fictional character from the comic book series The Walking Dead and is portrayed by Chandler Riggs in the American television series of the same name, which airs on AMC in the United States. The character was created by writer Robert Kirkman and artist Tony Moore, and debuted in The Walking Dead #2 in 2003. In both forms of media, Carl is the son of primary protagonist Rick Grimes and is one of the longest-surviving characters.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">In the comic book series, Carl begins as a normal and innocent child, but, as the events of the new world order force him to grow up, he becomes colder and competently makes sometimes brash decisions for the good of his group of friends. The character's development is similar in the television series, where he is a normal boy before slowly adopting a callous and cold personality as a survival mechanism. This behaviour puts him into conflict with his father, who idealistically wishes to maintain Carl's childhood morality and innocence. Over time, and with reflection, Carl becomes alarmed and disturbed at his cold ways and, to some degree, regains his sense of morality while still keeping his survival edge. At the same time, his father begins to lose his morality, which eventually puts Carl at odds with him for various reasons, particularly in regards to helping people in need, whom the group meet in their travels.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">For his performance as Carl, Riggs won the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor in 2014. He was also nominated for the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series Leading Young Actor in 2012 and 2013.</p>

          <p height="10" width="250">Carl is the only son of deputy sheriff Rick Grimes and his wife, Lori Grimes. When the dead rise, Lori takes Carl to a purported safe zone in Atlanta, Georgia, along with Rick's partner, Shane Walsh. Lori and Carl join a group of survivors on the outskirts of Atlanta, formed and led by Shane. There, they are eventually reunited with Rick. Despite being only seven years old, Carl is taught to shoot a pistol. This comes in handy when he saves his mother from an attacking walker. Later, he is forced to kill an unstable Shane in order to protect his father.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">After the group buries Shane and leaves Atlanta, Carl is shot and wounded by ranch foreman Otis while searching for supplies in the woods. The survivors are brought to the farm of Otis' employer, veterinarian Hershel Greene, who successfully treats Carl. The group remains at the farm for several days until tensions cause Hershel to evict them.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">They eventually find an abandoned prison. While there, Carl and the others enjoy the prison's luxuries, such as hot showers and open space. He is confronted with disturbing experiences, such as witnessing numerous counts of violence/death. While Rick was away with other survivors, he frequently gave Lori re-assurance about his well-being. Throughout Lori's pregnancy, Carl was thrilled with the idea of a baby sister and when Judith is born he is fiercely protective over her. When The Governor and his army attack the prison, Carl managed to escape with Rick.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">During the journey, while returning to Kentucky with Rick and Abraham, he is nearly raped by a group of rednecks before his father manages to kill all of them. In the aftermath of their murders, Carl confesses to killing Shane and being a different person than he was before the apocalypse. Shortly after their return to the main group, Carl witnesses a fellow child survivor murder his brother, and he secretly kills the child when he realizes no one else is willing to do it. He feels deep grief, but does not regret his actions.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">When they arrive at a gated community in D.C., Carl is unable to fit in with the other children due because of his horrific experiences in the dangerous outside world and the false sense of security the other children had. During a zombie attack, Carl is shot in the face, losing his right eye, and in a coma for weeks. When he wakes up and again is taken care of by Rick, he shows a much more negative outlook, berating his father for all of the horrible things that have happened because of him.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">When Rick decides to attack a group of survivors known as the Saviors, they retaliate by killing Glenn. Rick decides to create the illusion of falling in line with their leader, Negan, but is actually trying to find more information about the group when Carl decides to sneak into one of the Saviors' vans and launch an assault on them, ending with him as Negan's new "guest". Negan grows a liking for Carl, although Carl remains resentful towards him. Not long after, Carl is returned to Rick unharmed. He accompanies Rick to "The Kingdom", a neighboring settlement led by Ezekiel. There, they plan to go to war with The Saviors. Carl stays back in the Safe Zone while Rick ventures out to Negan's stronghold for war.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">After the two year time gap, Carl decides he wants to leave the Safe Zone to journey to The Hilltop and start an apprenticeship with Earl Sutton, the blacksmith. Shortly after arriving there, two boys attack him and Sophia who Carl beats off with a shovel, nearly killing them. He is temporarily held in a cell where he bonds with Lydia, a survivor from a rival group, The Whisperers. After being let out Carl convinces Maggie to let Lydia out under his watch and they bond further eventually Lydia seduces him and they make love.[volume & issue needed] Though Carl and Lydia grow even closer after this Lydia's mother "Alpha" arrives at the Hilltop's gates demanding Lydia back or she will attack and Maggie is forced to hand her over, a decision that highly enrages Carl. Later when Sophia goes to check on Carl he is missing and is revealed to have sneaked out after Lydia.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">Carl is Lori and Rick Grimes' son and Judith's elder brother/half-brother, depending on who her father actually is. Carl loved both his parents, even though they began to have marital issues. Upon learning of his father's shooting days before the outbreak, he is devastated, even wanting to give a blood transfusion to help which his mother talks him out of. When the outbreak begins, Shane Walsh and Lori take him to the supposed safe zone in Atlanta. On the way there, he is told that his father is dead, and he gradually began to accept it but had little time to mourn. On the way to Atlanta when traffic is backed up Carl, Lori and Shane meet Carol, Ed and their daughter Sophia who Carl quickly becomes friends with. They set up camp with other survivors on the outskirts of Atlanta, Carl begins to look at Shane as a father figure, as he does various activities with him such as fishing and learns some survival skills from him, but appeared to be oblivious to Shane and Lori's ongoing sexual relationship.</p>
