          <p height="10" width="250">In season 2, Carl is shown to be yearning for more responsibility within the group, such as helping to scavenge for supplies. In the season premiere "What Lies Ahead", while searching for the missing Sophia, Carl is shot and wounded. In the episode "Bloodletting", Otis, the man who accidentally shot Carl, leads Rick and Shane to a nearby farm. The owner, Hershel Greene, treats Carl but reveals he will need surgery to save his life. In the episode "Save the Last One", Carl wakes up briefly and talks to Lori about the deer he saw right before he was shot. Shane returns with the necessary medical equipment for the surgery, but lies about the fact that he shot Otis to save his own life. Hershel operates and saves his life. In the episode "Cherokee Rose", Carl wakes up as he recovers, and Rick gives Carl his hat and badge. In the episode "Chupacabra", Carl appears in a flashback from before he and the group arrived at the camp outside of Atlanta. In the episode "Secrets", Carl is recovered and helps his mom feed chickens on the farm; he begins to develop a colder mindset, which worries Lori. In the mid-season finale "Pretty Much Dead Already", it is revealed that Sophia was a walker and being kept in Hershel's barn; Carl watches as Rick shoots Sophia in the head.</p>
          <p height="10" width="250">In the mid-season premiere "Nebraska", Carl's new colder mindset continues to develop following the reveal of Sophia as a walker. In the episode "Triggerfinger", Carl learns that Lori is pregnant. In the episode "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Carl denies the idea of heaven and shows disrespect towards Sophia's mother Carol for mentioning that Sophia was in heaven. Carl finds a walker stuck in mud in the woods and taunts it, but the walker frees itself and starts chasing him; this walker later finds Dale and mortally wounds him. In the season's penultimate episode "Better Angels", Carl saves his father by shooting Shane, who had become a walker. In the season finale "Beside the Dying Fire", Carl's gunshot attracts a horde of walkers and so the group is ultimately driven off the farm.</p>
