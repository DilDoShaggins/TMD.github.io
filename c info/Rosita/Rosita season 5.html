							<th height="250" width="600"> In the season premiere "No Sanctuary", Rosita is first seen early in the episode, making a weapon trying to escape the train car, made by undoing her earrings and attaching them to a belt. After the attempt to escape fails, she remains trapped in the boxcar. Later in the episode Sasha asks Eugene about the cure, and she says they want to know about the cure, which Rosita replies they don't have to know. When Rick, Daryl, Glenn and Bob comes to the rescue, Rosita joins them in their escape and kills walkers. Then she runs to the fence, finding a way to climb over and out of Terminus, therefore saving the group from being trapped inside with the walkers. Rick wants to go back and kill Gareth and the other Terminus residents but Rosita advises against it since it's already engulfed in flames. When Rick tells the group they need to leave, Abraham tells her they'll let him know about the mission to D.C. later. In the episode "Strangers", Rosita goes to the Church with the rest of the group and takes refuge with Father Gabriel Stokes. In the episode "Four Walls and a Roof", she, Carl and Tyreese remain behind to help guard Eugene, Gabriel, baby Judith and a dying Bob when Rick leads a group to ambush Gareth who is trying to kill them and use them as food, as they did Bob. After Gareth and the Hunters are killed, she later leaves on the church bus with Abraham, Eugene, Tara, Glenn and Maggie to go to Washington DC to stop the virus. </th>

							<th height="250" width="600"> In the episode "Self Help", Rosita flirts with Abraham on the bus, teasing him about his hair; she promises to cut it that evening. The bus then crashes and flips over. She leaves the bus with Maggie and begins killing walkers. Abraham orders Rosita to check Eugene but he insists he's fine. When everyone leaves she stays behind whilst Eugene spits on the walker. Later that night Maggie gives Rosita a piece of book thread so she can stitch up Abraham's hand. Rosita stitches his arm and remarks that some former members of their group taught her these medic skills. Whilst Rosita and Abraham are having sex that night she points out that Eugene is watching them again, and that he's in, of all places, the self-help section. They laugh together - not unkindly - and carry on. Rosita checks Abeâ€™s hand the next day and argues that they should rest for that day. Abraham is not interested and insists they carry on. Rosita's clearly not happy with his response but is quick to back him up when, a few moments later, Maggie and Glenn enter and make the same suggestion, showing support for him. Rosita points out that the air intake for the fire truck they're trying to get moving is on the roof, and not where Abraham is fiddling with. When walkers attack she fights some off before Eugene deals with them. Later when they see the large herd of walkers she argues with Abraham that they need to go around the herd, disagreeing with him in front of the others for the first time. When things start to get physical she still argues with him; at one point Abraham pushes her to the ground as he's frog marching Eugene back to the fire truck, clearly shocking her. When Eugene reveals that he's been lying all along Rosita is shocked. She insists he is a scientist and angrily points out that many people died trying to get him to DC. When Abraham beats Eugene unconscious, Rosita stops him from hurting Eugene more, with her hand on her sidearm, ready to lift her handgun. She then tries to wake Eugene up. </th>

							<th height="250" width="600"> In the episode "Crossed", Rosita is first seen offering Abraham water, which he hits away. She shouts at him and he stands up, looking threatening. Maggie makes him back away from Rosita at gunpoint. Later on her, Glenn and Tara trek to a river to refill their water supplies. They come across a few walkers trapped under a pole where Tara makes a joke about them not needing to get up as there is nothing for them in DC. Rosita does not approve of the joke. At the river the water is full of mud and dirt, but Rosita knows how to make a water filter because Eugene showed her how. While filtering water, Rosita talks to them about when she first met Abraham. When they discover fish in the water, they head back to the walkers and kill them to take their clothes and make a net. Rosita and Glenn use the net to catch a fish, which Rosita knows how to clean. Glenn tells her that's a useful skill for wherever they end up, telling her that whatever happens with Eugene and Abraham, she's welcome to be a part of their group. They then head back to the fire truck. In the mid-season finale "Coda", once they make it back to the church, they then head to Atlanta to Grady Memorial Hospital to try and rescue Maggie's sister Beth but arrive too late as Beth has been killed. Rosita appears visibly shocked, covering her mouth as she is upset over Maggie's loss. </th>

							<th height="250" width="600"> In the mid-season premiere "What Happened and What's Going On", Rosita appears at Tyreese's funeral. In the episode "Them", Rosita is with the group on the long trek they are on. She reassures everyone that Abraham is okay with his constant drinking, but doesn't interact with him, choosing to sit with others instead. She helps keep the barn doors closed when a herd attacks. In the episode "The Distance", Rosita goes with Abraham, Michonne, and Glenn to see if they can find Aaron's vehicles. She uses a stick to take out a walker and saves Abraham from one. When they search the RV, Abraham finds some food the group used to eat and Rosita reminiscences on the past with him, and Abraham asks if Rosita believed he would hit her after what happened with Eugene. However she replies "no" as she knows him better. She rides the RV on both legs of the journey to Alexandria, sitting in the passenger seat with a map. When they spot DC in the distance she calls to Abraham and remember their former goal and he is happy to have finally made it. She then arrives at Alexandria with the group, being one of the first off the RV. In the episode "Remember", Rosita enters Alexandria with the rest of her group. She can be seen residing in the house with everyone during the first few nights of their stay in Alexandria. In the episode "Forget", Rosita arrives at Deanna's party with Abraham. They both appear to be uncomfortable, but she relaxes after she mentions there is beer and smiles when Abraham goes off to grab some drinks. Later, she can be seen enjoying herself while chatting with Glenn and Maggie. In the episode "Spend", Rosita appears briefly sleeping in bed while Abraham washes his face after they appear to have had sex. In the episode "Try", Rosita tells Michonne that Sasha has gone missing from her post in the tower. Worried, they venture outside the walls to look for her where they discus how different it feels to be outside, now that they have a home. They find several dead walkers and realize Sasha is actively hunting them. They track her down and help her eliminate a large pack of walkers, which leads to an outburst from Sasha. However when she calms down she reveals she is really feeling guilty because she told Noah that he'd die, (which occurs in the previous episode). In the season finale "Conquer", Rosita is tending to Tara when Abraham walks in with some flowers and tries to leave when he sees Eugene asleep in a chair next to her, but Rosita convinces him to stay. As Abraham tries to quietly sit without waking Eugene, Rosita deliberately drops some pots to wake him and the two men ultimately reconcile. Later Tara wakes up from unconsciousness while Rosita is sitting watch over her. </th>
