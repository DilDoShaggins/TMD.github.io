						<th height="250" width="600"> Glenn Rhee is a fictional character from the comic book series The Walking Dead and was portrayed by Steven Yeun in the AMC television series of the same name. He was also voiced by Nick Herman in the video game of the same name, by Telltale Games. In the comics, he is known simply as Glenn and was not given a last name. Glenn was the Atlanta survival camp's primary supply runner in both mediums, proving to be loyal and smart. He later formed a long term relationship with Maggie and married her. In the comic book series, he took on the role of a surrogate father to Sophia following the suicide of Carol, her biological mother. </th>

						<th height="50" width="400"> Resourceful and clever, Glenn made it out of Atlanta and came upon the group of survivors on the outer limits of the city. Due to his knack for scavenging, Glenn is often nominated to sneak into the city and find supplies. On one of these runs, he found Rick and brought him back to the group, reuniting them with his family. His use of MacGyver-like tactics to outsmart and kill zombies enabled him to successfully recover guns for Jim. Not long after Shane died, Glenn develops a nascent crush on Maggie, but his shyness initially prevents him from acting on his feelings. </th>

						<th height="50" width="1500"> Glenn settled into a prison-turned-refuge with Maggie and helps the group find fuel and supplies. He was later imprisoned by the Governor, an encounter that left him with physical and mental scars; Glenn was beaten and forced to hear The Governor brutally rape Michonne in a neighboring cell. After his escape and return to the prison, Glenn grows to love Maggie and proposed to her with a ring stolen from a zombie's finger; Hershel married the couple shortly after. Soon after their marriage, Glenn and Maggie volunteered to join the group that traveled to the Army Center to prevent enemies from Woodbury from using its fuel for their vehicles. The group was attacked by Bruce and his friends. Glenn, distracted, allowed Andrea to snipe Bruce and Michonne to kill the rest of the attackers. He fiercely defended the prison from a front gate sniper tower. With the group divided on what to do next, Glenn decided to leave with Dale and Andrea in the R.V. at the last minute, saving Sophia and Maggie's lives (at this point, Sophia saw him as a surrogate father). He, Maggie, and Sophia stayed at Hershel's farm with Dale and Andrea. </th>

					<tr>
						<th height="50" width="1500"> When the group encountered survivors at the farm, Glenn did not like or trust Abraham Ford, Rosita Espinosa, or Eugene Porter. However, he agreed to accompany them to Washington for Eugene's mission rather than stay at the farm any longer. On the road, Maggie attempted to hang herself and Glenn fought with Abraham, who intended to shoot her. Glenn cut down Maggie and performed CPR, breaking down in tears, but soon flared into rage at Abraham when the group realized she was still alive. Glenn's focus shifted from scavenging to caring for his new family and supporting Maggie after the death of her entire family. With the rest of the group, he traveled to the Alexandria Safe-Zone. Glenn was suspicious of the Safe-Zone's community but adapted more rapidly than Rick. Glenn's useful skills and agility made him a suitable applicant to once again be a scavenger and a replacement for the wounded Scott. Glenn's new job made Maggie unhappy, due to the danger he would face and they argued which resulted in Glenn leaving the house for a bit. </th>

						<th height="50" width="1500"> Rick asked Glenn, due to his loyalty, to steal back their guns and weapons, which were taken by Douglas Monroe, when they first came to the Safety-zone. Glenn made a distraction for the Community's survivors while he looked for the location of the weapons for Rick. Rick and Glenn found the armory, and Glenn snuck in. Rick distributed the weapons amongst the members of their group. </th>

					<tr>
						<th height="50" width="1500"> After the issues with Douglas were solved Glenn and Maggie lived at Alexandria for some time and decided that Alexandria would be the best place to raise a child as they had wanted to for sometime now. After a few attempts Maggie finally told Glenn that she was indeed pregnant and both were overjoyed to be bringing a new child into this world. However their celebration was short-lived as a group called the Saviors attempt to break into the community numerous times and, Glenn convinces Maggie to leave the community with him and Sophia, and head toward the Hilltop Colony, which he believes to be a much safer place. As they were camped on the road after driving halfway to the Hilltop, they are ambushed by The Saviors. Because of the number of Saviors already killed by Rick and the group, Glenn is selected at random and viciously bludgeoned to death by the leader of the Saviors, Negan, while helplessly crying Maggie's name as she is distraught. Rick and everyone else are left with Glenn's mangled corpse as The Saviors drive away, with Rick swearing to avenge Glenn's death. </th>

						<th height="50" width="1500"> His death initially leaves the group shattered, with Maggie quickly descending into an emotional mess and Rick on the verge of yielding to Negan's power. Glenn's body is later driven by the group to the Hilltop, where it is to be buried in a matter of days. To honor Glenn's final wishes, Maggie chooses to remain at the Hilltop with Sophia and start a new life while awaiting their baby. </th>
