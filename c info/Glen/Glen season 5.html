						<th height="250" width="600"> In the season premiere "No Sanctuary", Glenn and the others create makeshift weapons to fight off their captors, but the Terminus guards instead drop a flashbang grenade into the boxcar, and drag Glenn, Rick, Daryl, and Bob out. They are taken to the slaughterhouse and lined up bending over a pig trough next where four other male survivors are brutally slaughtered over the pig trough but just as Glenn is next Gareth walks in and questions one of the guards about the survivors. An explosion caused by Carol distracts Gareth and allows Rick to break free from his cuffs, kill the guards, then set Glenn, Daryl and Bob free. The four soon discover that the people of Terminus are cannibals and Rick orders everyone shot on sight. They make their way back to the boxcar and free their friends as they fight their way out. As Glenn tries to oppose Rick's plan to go back they are reunited with Carol, Tyreese and Judith and move on. In the episode "Strangers", the group hear screams for help. They go and assist the man from a group of walkers. He introduces himself as Gabriel. He takes the survivors back to his church, which they quickly check is secure and not a trap. It's then decided that the group will need to go and fetch supplies. Glenn goes with Maggie and Tara to scavenge a weapons store, where he finds three silencers in a mini fridge. The group celebrate as Abraham makes a toast. In the episode "Four Walls and a Roof", the group discover Bob was captured by the cannibals of Terminus and is being used as bait, having been eaten on the leg. Bob reveals he is bitten, to which Glenn reminds to Rick that Jim had lasted two days before turning. When Abraham announces that he's taking Eugene and leaving to ensure his survival, an argument breaks out between him and Rick when he insists on taking the bus. Glenn manages to stop the argument by promising Abraham that if he stays for one more night to help deal with Gareth and the Hunters, then he and Maggie will leave with Abraham on the church bus the following morning. Abraham reluctantly agrees. Glenn says goodbye to Bob before he leaves to go to Washington with Maggie, Tara, Abraham, Eugene and Rosita. </th>

						<th height="50" width="1500"> In the episode "Self Help", on their journey to DC, the bus crashes and the survivors face multiple walker problems including a herd consisting of thousands which Abraham tries to insist they go through despite Glenn attempting to reason with him. Eugene reveals he crashed the bus and admits that he lied about the cure, Glenn is stunned by the revelation and Abraham reacts in rage and violently punches Eugene and Glenn and Rosita try to stop him as they attempt to wake up Eugene. In the episode "Crossed", Glenn, Tara and Rosita bond as Maggie watches over Eugene and Abraham, as Eugene is unconscious after his beating and Abraham is unresponsive. In the mid-season finale "Coda", the group return to the church to discover Beth is alive and at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta.

						<th height="50" width="1500"> In the mid-season premiere "What Happened and What's Going On", two weeks after Beth's death the group is heading to Richmond, Virginia to find Noah's refuge following Rick's desire to fulfill Beth's last wish. However Glenn is doubtful that Noah's sanctuary is still there and his suspicions are proven true as they find the sanctuary in ruin and he and Rick start debating the logic in searching, and Beth's fate at Dawn's hand. Rick states he knew Dawn didn't mean to do it but would have killed her anyway if Daryl hadn't and Glenn noted that it wouldn't make a difference, making Michonne concerned about them debating killing someone makes her want to stop running and find a place to live. She later presses this when they find walker limbs, cut up, and insists on Washington again but Glenn is doubtful as Eugene was lying but Rick decides to take a chance. Later Glenn helps Michonne cut off Tyreese's arm when he is bitten and tries to haul him to safety, briefly being delayed by a truck opening and letting out numerous walker bodies with no arms and legs with "w"'s cut into thehr foreheads, but Tyreese dies from blood loss and Glenn stands over his service. In the episode "Them", Glenn tries to comfort a grieving Maggie, still distraught over Beth's death, after she begins to doubt if she wants to live anymore. Glenn is also the sole member of the group with water during the drought and tries to make at least one member of the group drink some and later helps defend the barn they're staying in from a walker herd. In the episode "The Distance", when Maggie and Sasha bring in a stranger named Aaron who claims to have a community of good people nearby and wants them to join, Glenn leads a small group of Michonne, Maggie, Abraham and Rosita to investigate his claim of nearby cars. After learning he was telling to truth of the cars the group takes off at night to avoid suspicion but when they get paranoid about Aaron again they are forced to drive through a herd of walkers and escape on foot. However Glenn begins to trust Aaron again when they meet his boyfriend Eric, confirming his earlier claim there was only one person with him and begs Rick to do so as well. Later when the R.V. breaks down Glenn shows an angry Abraham where to find another battery to which he says" how'd you know those were there?" and Glenn just smiles, referencing Dale's teachings. Eventually the group arrives at Aaron's community the Alexandria Safe-Zone. In the episode "Remember", Glenn and the others are interviewed by Deanna Monroe, Alexandria's leader, and he admits the sense of brutality he has developed from being in the world for too long and how he needs to make it work and Deanna offers Glenn the job of supply runner. When the group is given two houses to divide among themselves they decide to sleep all together in one house to be cautious and the next day Glenn, Tara and Noah accompany Deanna's son Adien and his friend Nicholas on a run but learn they've strung a walker up as a warning and they try to reattach it which Glenn kills before it can kill Tara which enrages Adien. Once back at the safe zone Glenn provokes Aiden into fighting him until Rick and Deanna break it up and Deanna addresses the community to accept the group and personally thanks Glenn for knocking Aiden "on his ass". </th>

						<th height="50" width="1500"> In the episode "Forget", Glenn appears at the party at Deanna's house, where he assures Noah that he is family now. In the episode "Spend", Glenn, Noah, Tara, Eugene, Aiden, and Nicholas head to a warehouse to scavenge parts to repair Alexandria's solar power system. As they approach the warehouse, they find that the front area is infested with walkers, though a cage prevents them from being able to enter. As the group enters, they encounter a zombified soldier wearing body armor. Despite Glenn's pleas not to shoot it, Aiden fires at the walker several times and hits one of its grenades, causing an explosion. Tara is critically wounded, and Aiden is apparently killed. The explosion also weakens the cage, allowing walkers to enter the warehouse. The group falls back, only to discover Aiden is still alive, but impaled by two pieces of metal. As Glenn, Noah, and Nicholas go to save Aiden, Eugene carries Tara out of the warehouse. With the walkers closing in, Nicholas panics and flees, forcing Glenn and Noah to abandon Aiden, who is eaten alive by walkers. Glenn, Noah, and Nicholas take shelter inside a revolving door, but are trapped by walkers on both sides. Eugene arrives in the van and lures the walkers on the outside away. However, Nicholas pushes his way out, leaving Glenn and Noah vulnerable. The walkers grab Noah and tear him apart as Glenn watches in horror. Nicholas goes to the van and tells Eugene they must leave immediately. When Eugene refuses, Nicholas pulls him out of the van and tries to leave without him. Glenn arrives and knocks Nicholas out. Glenn then proceeds to put him in the van, instead of leaving him behind. In the episode "Try", Glenn relates the true series of events to Rick. Deanna bans Glenn and Nicholas from the armory and leaving the Safe-Zone while she investigates. Glenn confronts Nicholas and tells him men like him should have died to the walkers, but he was lucky Alexandria's walls came up. Glenn threatens Nicholas, warning him never to set foot outside of the walls again. In the season finale "Conquer", Glenn sees Nicholas climbing over the wall and grows suspicious and follows him out. While tracking him, Glenn is shot and wounded by Nicholas. Glenn manages to escape, and later attacks Nicholas when he is off-guard. A struggle ensues and Nicholas manages to escape, leaving Glenn to defend himself against walkers they attracted. As Nicholas tries to escape, Glenn tracks him down and holds him at gunpoint. Nicholas begs for his life, and Glenn spares him. </th>
