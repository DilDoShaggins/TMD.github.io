						<th height="250" width="600"> In the season premiere "What Lies Ahead", Glenn continues to be a valuable asset to the group, helping to repair the RV and scavenging items from abandoned cars on the highway. In the episode "Bloodletting", Glenn, Lori, Carol, Daryl, and Andrea continue to search near the highway for Carol's daughter Sophia. In the episode "Save the Last One", Glenn and T-Dog arrive at Hershel Greene's farm, where Carl is recovering from a gunshot wound. He sparks up a friendship with Hershel's daughter Maggie when she catches him praying for Carl. In the episode "Cherokee Rose", Glenn agrees to act as live bait to draw a trapped walker out of a well, but this goes badly and he almost falls into the well. Glenn and Maggie later decide to go into town to get supplies from a pharmacy, when Lori discreetly asks him to get her a pregnancy test as well. When Maggie asks him what he's looking for, he tries to make an excuse and accidentally grabs a box of condoms. Maggie then seduces him and they have sex. In the episode "Chupacabra", Glenn learns that Lori is pregnant, and she begs him not to tell Rick. Maggie expresses to Glenn that their fling was a one-time thing, but Glenn tries to convince her that their romance should continue. Later at dinner, Maggie slips Glenn a note under the table asking him where they can have another sexual encounter; Glenn writes an answer and returns the note. After the meal ends Maggie opens the note with Glenn's response saying that he will meet her in the barn outside. A horrified Maggie hurries outside and runs toward the barn, but she is unable to prevent Glenn from discovering that the locked building is full of walkers. In the episode "Secrets", Maggie begs Glenn not to tell the others about the barn, but he soon reveals this secret and Lori's pregnancy to Dale. Maggie feels frustrated and betrayed by Glenn when he does not keep his promise that he will not reveal that zombies are in the barn. She forgives him soon afterwards however, and they start to engage in a relationship. In the mid-season finale "Pretty Much Dead Already", Glenn tells the rest of the group about the barn, and Shane eventually breaks the barn open, leading Glenn and the other survivors to kill all of the walkers as they file out of the barn, including a now-zombified Sophia. </th>

						<th height="50" width="1500"> In the mid-season premiere "Nebraska", Hershel disappears after the incident at the barn. Before Glenn and Rick leave for town to find Maggie's father, Maggie tells Glenn she loves him. Glenn leaves before saying it back. They find Hershel in a bar and inform him that his youngest daughter, Beth, has collapsed and is in need of medical attention. They attempt to talk him into returning to the farm, but he refuses. Two men from another group, Dave and Tony, find them. An argument leads to a violent confrontation, and Rick kills the two men. In the episode "Triggerfinger", more armed men from Dave and Tony's group come looking for them, and they get into a shootout with Glenn, Rick, and Hershel. Glenn is wracked with embarrassment and guilt after freezing during the shootout with outsiders. They capture one of the attackers, named Randall, before they all return to the farm. Glenn blames his inaction in town on his deep love for Maggie, and apparently breaks up with her when they get back to the farm. In the episode "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Hershel gives Glenn a family heirloom, representing his approval of Glenn's relationship with Maggie. In the episode "Better Angels", when Randall apparently escapes, Rick, Shane, Daryl, and Glenn go on a manhunt for the fugitive; Shane leads Rick one direction while Daryl and Glenn comb another part of the woods. Glenn and Daryl find and kill Randall who has inexplicably reanimated from the dead as a walker despite no signs of a bite wound. In the season finale "Beside the Dying Fire", when the farm is overrun by walkers, Glenn plays a big part in its defense. During the chaos, he convinces Maggie to abandon the farmyard for the meantime so as to avoid any further danger. He later assures her that her family is safe, and seeing the right opportunity, confesses his love for her. The two eventually reunite with the other survivors at the highway. After discovering that Rick kept secret the fact that they are all infected, Glenn is among the survivors who grow wary of Rick. He and Maggie contemplate leaving camp and abandoning Rick's leadership. They, however, dismiss such thoughts after Rick taunts the group with the option of leaving on their own. </th>
