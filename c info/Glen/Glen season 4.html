						<th height="250" width="600"> In the season premiere "30 Days Without an Accident", Glenn and Maggie get a pregnancy scare and decides to go out on a run in her place. When he gets back to the prison, Maggie tells him she is not pregnant. In the episode "Infected", Glenn is seen shouting about walkers being in a cell block during an attack. He later meets with the rest of the prison council about what to do about a possible deadly viral outbreak, and they begin quarantining the sick. In the episode "Isolation", Glenn falls ill and is quarantined with the other sick prisoners. In the episode "Internment", despite their illness, Glenn and Sasha help Hershel treat the other survivors with the virus. Glenn falls unconscious and recovers after Hershel saves him. Bob returns from a supply run with antibiotics and administers them to Glenn. In the mid-season finale "Too Far Gone", when the Governor arrives and attacks the prison, Glenn is rescued by Maggie and gets separated from her once the bus leaves. </th>

						<th height="50" width="600"> In the mid-season premiere "Inmates", after the prison attack, Glenn wakes up and finds himself trapped in the prison after leaving the escape bus. He heads to his room and finds the photo he took of Maggie. He grabs his riot gear, assault rifle, and an alcohol bottle from a survivor and heads out. Along the way, he encounters Tara, a survivor of the attacking army. She explains that she was the reason behind this and has no need for living as she watched her sister and niece die. She also tells him about the death of Hershel, which leaves Glenn saddened. Glenn convinces her that they need each other to get out alive. Glenn throws the bottle at a nearby car to distract the zombies and he and Tara escape. Along the road, Tara mentions that The Governor told her that the prison group were bad people and she didn't believe him for one second. She then apologizes for everything. They both get attacked by walkers and Glenn passes out. As Tara kills the last zombie, a military truck pulls up and three people climb out: Abraham Ford, Eugene Porter, and Rosita Espinosa. In the episode "Claimed", Abraham convinces Tara to accompany them on their trek to Washington D.C. so Eugene can hopefully stop the virus and save the world, and they put an unconscious Glenn in the back of the truck. When Glenn wakes up, he bashes the back window until Abraham stops and gets out. Glenn insists on searching for Maggie, but when Abraham insists that Maggie is dead the two men brawl. The commotion draws walkers, and when Eugene tries to shoot them he accidentally cripples their vehicle. Glenn takes this as a sign that he should find Maggie and Tara decides to go with them, then Rosita follows and Eugene tells Abraham that they should go along until they can find a new vehicle. In the episode "Alone", Glenn discovers a sign leading to Terminus. In the episode "Us", the group begins to see signs from Maggie that they should go to Terminus and when the group comes to a tunnel, Abraham can't bring himself to risk Eugene's life and they part ways, leaving Glenn and Tara to go through the tunnel alone. They come across the dead wandering around an area in the tunnel that has collapsed and while sneaking around them, Tara falls down the debris and is trapped. Glenn refuses to leave her and begins beating off the zombies, when they are rescued by Maggie, Sasha, Bob, Eugene, Abraham and Rosita. Reunited with Maggie, they all decide to continue to Terminus where they meet with the refugees. In the season finale "A", it is revealed that they have been imprisoned in a railroad car when Rick and his group are also imprisoned in the same car. </th>
