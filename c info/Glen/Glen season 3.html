						<th height="250" width="600"> In the season premiere "Seed", six to seven months after leaving the farm, Glenn has become increasingly proficient at fighting zombies. He and Maggie continue to have a strong relationship. The group finds a prison and decides to make it their new home. While clearing out part of the prison, Glenn and Maggie get separated from Hershel and Hershel gets bitten by a walker, forcing Rick to cut Hershel's leg off below the knee to prevent the infection from spreading. In the episode "Sick", Glenn escorts Carol to the prison yard so that she can practice a C-section in preparation for Lori's delivery. In the episode "Killer Within", when Andrew lets walkers into the prison yard to attack the survivors, Glenn helps kill the walkers and stabilize the prison, but not before T-Dog and Lori are killed. In the episode "Say the Word", Glenn finds Rick losing control and pleads for him to stop, but Rick nearly assaults Glenn. In the episode "Hounded", while out on a supply run, Glenn and Maggie are ambushed and captured by Merle and brought to Woodbury for interrogation. In the episode "When the Dead Come Knocking", Merle brutally beats Glenn while trying to find the whereabouts of their camp. Despite this, as well as being forced to fight a walker while strapped to a chair and having the Governor threaten to shoot Maggie, Glenn remains unbroken. But when the Governor threatens to shoot Glenn, Maggie tells her about the prison and their group. In the mid-season finale "Made to Suffer", when Glenn and Maggie attempt to escape, the Governor orders Merle to execute them; they fight back and Merle's group is overwhelmed by Rick's group. Rick, Glenn, and Maggie escape over the wall, and meet up with Michonne. </th>

						<th height="50" width="1500"> In the mid-season premiere "The Suicide King", while Glenn remains behind, Rick and Maggie set off smoke grenades, killing several Woodbury residents and rescuing Merle and Daryl in the process. Glenn shows great frustration (at one point bludgeoning a walker pulled from a nearby vehicle) when he finds out that not only is Merle going with them, but Rick had not taken the opportunity to kill the Governor as well (still believing that he raped Maggie when they were held captive). They return to the prison without Merle and Daryl, but Glenn's relationship with Maggie begins to fall apart, despite her claims that the Governor threatened to cut off his hand if she refused to bow down to him. Rick has a breakdown while meeting Tyreese's group, and Glenn escorts them out of the room when Rick starts yelling. In the episode "Home", with Rick losing control of himself, Glenn decides to impose himself as leader of the group, thinking about killing the Governor when he will not be expecting it. As he leaves on a scouting mission, he misses an attack made on the prison by the Governor, which results in Axel's death and the destruction of the main security gates. In the episode "I Ain't a Judas", when Rick argues with Hershel about leaving the prison, Glenn agrees with Rick that they should stay and fight. In the episode "Arrow on the Doorpost", Merle wants to kill the Governor during his meeting with Rick, but Glenn gets into a brawl with Merle to keep him from leaving the prison. Glenn begins to let go of some of his anger, and his relationship with Maggie improves. In the episode "This Sorrowful Life", Glenn asks Hershel for his permission to marry Maggie, and Hershel gives Glenn his blessing. Glenn then asks Maggie to marry him, and she says yes. In the season finale "Welcome to the Tombs", the Governor launches his assault on the prison, but the group is prepared. Glenn and Maggie fight back while wearing riot gear. Later, when Rick returns with the survivors from Woodbury, and Glenn opens the prison gates for them. </th>
