						<th height="250" width="600"> In the season premiere "What Lies Ahead", the group becomes stalled on the highway as Carol's daughter Sophia becomes separated from the group and lost. Shane tells Lori that he is planning to leave the group, and they argue about this. In the episode "Bloodletting", Carl has accidentally been shot by Otis and taken to Hershel's farm, so Hershel's daughter Maggie came on horseback to retrieve Lori. Shane and Otis leave the farm to retrieve the needed medical supplies for Hershel to perform the surgery needed to save Carl's life. In the episode "Save the Last One", Hershel informs Rick and Lori that he may need to do the operation without the equipment, and as Rick and Lori relent, Shane returns with the needed supplies but reports that Otis gave his own life to ensure Shane's safety. In the episode "Cherokee Rose", days after arriving at the farm, Lori asks Glenn to bring something back from a pharmacy, which turns out to be a pregnancy test. Lori discovers much to her dismay that she is pregnant, and immediately realizes that the baby could be Shane's or Rick's. In the episode "Chupacabra", Glenn learns that Lori is pregnant, and she begs him not to tell Rick. Lori and Carol make a dinner for Hershel as thanks for letting them stay on his farm. In the episode "Secrets", after struggling with whether to keep the baby (going as far as having Glenn retrieve "Morning After" pills for her and swallowing several before forcing herself to throw them back up), she begins to accept the predicament. However, before she is able to fully come to terms with the pregnancy, Rick, having found the boxes for her pills, confronts Lori about keeping the pregnancy a secret. Lori confesses that she struggled with the pregnancy, admitting the affair with Shane to Rick (which he nobly, if reluctantly, accepts and seemingly forgives her for) and expressing her fears about bringing a child into the broken world, where it would know only fear, hunger and pain. Reinforced by Rick's support, she finally accepts the pregnancy and makes it clear that, regardless of the child's paternity, it will be raised by her and Rick. In the mid-series finale "Pretty Much Dead Already", Glenn tells the group that Herhsel's barn is full of walkers. Shane finds out that Lori is pregnant, and she insists that the baby is Rick's. Shane eventually breaks open the barn and the group kills the walkers as they shamble out; when Sophia is revealed to be a walker, the last one to leave the barn, Lori comforts Carl who had befriended her. </th>

						<th height="50" width="600"> In the mid-season premiere "Nebraska", Hershel leaves the farm, and Rick and Glenn go to town to find him. Lori becomes concerns about Rick and goes off alone to find him, but crashes her car. In the episode "Triggerfinger", Shane goes looking for Lori, and tricks her into thinking that Rick had come back to the farm, to get her to come back with him. Shane and Lori have a private talk, where Shane reveals that his feelings during their relationship were real and that they should be together. When Rick does come back, Lori tells him that Shane thinks the baby is his, and that Shane had threatened Dale, and that Dale told her he felt that Shane killed Otis to save himself and may kill again. In the episode "18 Miles Out", Lori, Maggie, and Andrea take care of Hershel's younger daughter Beth, who was recovering from the shock of seeing her mother killed as one of the walkers in the barn. Beth becomes suicidal, and when Andrea encourages her to make her own choice about living, Lori and Maggie force themselves into the bathroom to find Beth had made an unsuccessful attempt to kill herself. In the episode "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Dale is mortally wounded by a walker and Daryl puts Dale out of his misery. In the episode "Better Angels", Lori's attitude toward Shane softens following Dale's death, as she apologizes for all that she had put him through since Rick's return. However, Shane still sees Rick as a threat and tries to kill him, but Rick was expecting an attack and kills Shane instead. When Shane reanimates as a walker, Carl shoots Shane in the head, but this gunshot attracts more walkers from the woods. In the season finale "Beside the Dying Fire", the group is forced to evacuate the farm and onto the road after a massive herd of walkers descends onto the property, during which time Lori is separated from Carl and Rick, fleeing with T-Dog and Beth. Shortly after reuniting with Rick and Carl at the original rendezvous point on the highway, Lori learns of the circumstances of Shane's death, and is deeply disturbed by Rick's lack of remorse over killing Shane, as well as the fact that Carl put him down when he turned. </th>
