						<th height="250" width="600"> In the season premiere "What Lies Ahead", Shane reveals to Lori that he plans to leave the group. However, he and Rick witness as Carl is accidentally shot. In "Bloodletting", Otis, the man who shot Carl, leads them to the farm of his employer, veterinarian Hershel Greene. To save Carl's life, Shane goes with Otis to retrieve medical supplies from a FEMA trailer at a nearby high school. In the episode "Save the Last One", in order to escape with the supplies, he shoots Otis and leaves him to the advancing walkers; he lies to the others, telling them that Otis willingly sacrificed himself. In the episode "Cherokee Rose", at the funeral for Otis, his girlfriend Patricia asks Shane to speak about his last moments, and Shane again lies. At the end of the episode, Lori learns that she is pregnant with what may be Shane's baby. In the episode "Chupacabra", while the group continues to search for the missing Sophia, Shane angrily tells Rick that they are wasting time searching for her, and that the group should head towards Fort Benning. In the episode "Secrets", Shane takes Andrea for gun training, and the two later go to a town searching for Sophia. When they come up empty, they wind up having sex in the car. In the mid-season finale "Pretty Much Dead Already", Glenn tells the group that Hershel's barn is full of walkers, and Shane demands that they kill all the walkers for their own protection. When Shane learns about Lori's pregnancy from Rick, Shane confronts Lori, who makes it clear that although she is uncertain who the biological father is, she and Rick alone will be raising the baby. Dale, concerned about Shane's erratic behavior, tries to hide the group's guns but Shane finds him and takes the guns back to the camp. Shane arms everyone in the group just before Rick and Hershel come back to the farm with two walkers. Hershel still believes that walkers are people, but Shane demonstrates this is untrue by shooting one of the walkers in its vital organs. Shane breaks off the lock to the barn, and as the walkers file out of the barn, he and the others shoot them; Sophia is the last walker to exit the barn, and when Shane can't shoot her, Rick does. </th>

						<th height="250" width="1500"> In the episode "Nebraska", Shane confronts Hershel about Sophia being in the barn, but Hershel denied any knowledge of this and said that Otis put the roaming walkers he found in the barn. Later in this episode, Lori goes searching for Rick, who went searching in town for Hershel, but she ends up having a car accident. In the episode "Triggerfinger", Shane rescues Lori, and they later talk privately, with Shane insisting that his feelings for her were real and they should be together. Rick comes back to camp with Randall, another survivor taken prisoner by the group after he attacked them and was injured, and Shane confronts Rick about this risky decision. In the episode "18 Miles Out", Rick and Shane tie up and blindfold Randall and plan to leave him at a school 18 miles from the farm. As they drive, Rick confronts Shane about what happened with Otis at the high school and his attraction to wife Lori. They find a seemingly secure building to leave Randall there, armed with a knife; as Randall pleads for his life, he revealed that he knew Maggie Greene from school, leading them to suspect that he knows the farm's location. Shane attempts to kill Randall but is stopped when Rick tackles him. They argue about what to do with Randall, escalating into a physical battle, which inadvertently releases a large group of walkers trapped inside a building. The three men fend off the walkers, and they return to the farm with Randall. Rick returns Shane's gun and tells Shane he needs to follow Rick's command from then on if he wants to remain part of the group. In the episode "Judge, Jury, Executioner", the group resolves to execute Randall. However, when Rick refuses to kill an unarmed man, Shane verbally taunts him, boasting that he would make a better leader than Rick and that Lori loves him instead. In the episode "Better Angels", Shane secretly releases Randall and kills him in the woods, telling the group that Randall attacked Shane and escaped. Shane then lures Rick into the woods under the pretense of searching for Randall, intending to kill Rick instead. Rick initially refuses to attack his friend and states that he believes Shane will not attack him if he is unarmed. To make this point, Rick begins to hand over his gun to Shane, which ends up being a ruse, as Rick pulls out a knife and stabs Shane to death. Rick sobs as he tells Shane that Shane made him do it. Carl, confused about what has taken place, happens upon the scene; Rick turns around to face Carl as Shane reanimates as a walker, and Carl then shoots Shane through the head. In the season finale "Beside the Dying Fire", it is revealed that Rick - knowing Shane's intentions in bringing him out to the woods - had played along; Rick says he had just wanted it to be over. </th>
