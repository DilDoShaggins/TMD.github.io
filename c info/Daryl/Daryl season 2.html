							<th height="250" width="600"> In season 2, Daryl is shown to be calmer and more cooperative and has developed fledgling friendships with various group members. He also reveals a more compassionate side, defending fellow group members' lives from walkers on multiple occasions and assisting them in their times of need. He slowly begins to form a bond with Carol, who was previously a victim of abuse like he was. </th>

						<tr>
							<th height="50" width="600"> In the season premiere "What Lies Ahead", Carol's daughter Sophia is separated from the rest of the group at the highway when walkers attack, and Daryl and Rick go looking for her but do not find her. In the episode "Bloodletting", Daryl continues searching for Sophia with Lori, Glenn, Carol, Daryl, and Andrea. Daryl later reveals that he has a bag full of painkillers and antibiotics left over from Merle, which he gives to Dale to treat the injured T-Dog. In the episode "Save the Last One", Daryl and Andrea continue the search for Sophia. In the episode "Cherokee Rose", the group moves their camp from the highway to Hershel's farm. When Carol is despondent due to the prolonged search for Sophia, Daryl gives her a flower, and she is visibly moved by his heartfelt speech that he gives to her about hope and keeping strong. In the episode "Chupacabra", Daryl borrows one of Hershel's horses to continue the search and finds Sophia's doll. When a snake spooks the horse, Daryl is thrown down a hillside and he is wounded by one of his crossbow bolts. He hallucinates Merle taunting him and criticizing him for joining Rick's group and searching for Sophia but not him. Daryl manages to climb the hill and stagger back to the farm. Andrea mistakes him for a walker and shoots him, grazing him in the head and knocking him unconscious. When he wakes up, Carol encourages him to think better of himself. In the episode "Secrets", while Daryl recuperates from his injuries, Andrea gives him a book as an apology. In the mid-season finale "Pretty Much Dead Already", Glenn tells the group that Hershel's barn is full of walkers. When Shane later breaks open the barn, Daryl helps kill the walkers as they file out. The last walker to come out of the barn is Sophia, forcing the group to realize that she had been killed and reanimated as a walker and that they were searching for her in the wilderness while she was really in the barn. Carol collapses in shock and grief, and Daryl comforts her as Rick is forced to kill Sophia. </th>

							<th height="50" width="1500"> In the mid-season premiere "Nebraska", he becomes emotionally detached from everyone and refuses to go out looking for people anymore. In the episode "Triggerfinger", Carol attempts to bring him back into the fold of the group, much to his frustration, and he attempts to avoid the group as much as possible, especially Carol. In the episode "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Daryl helps Rick and Shane with their prisoner, Randall, by interrogating him. Daryl later shoots Dale out of mercy with Rick's revolver when he is fatally attacked by a walker, as Rick is hesitant to kill him. In the episode "Better Angels", when Randall goes missing, Glenn and Daryl go looking in the woods for him. They find him reanimated as a walker and kill him, and are puzzled when it appears he died of a broken neck and they cannot find any bite marks on him. In the season finale "Beside the Dying Fire", when Lori begs Daryl to go search for Rick and Shane, the group notices a herd approaching the farm. The farm is ultimately overrun, and Daryl is forced to flee with Carol; they later meet up with the other survivors on the highway. Daryl tells Rick that Randall did not die of bite wounds, and Rick tells the whole group that Dr. Jenner revealed to him that everyone turns to a walker when they die. Daryl rebuffs Carol's attempts to convince him that they should go it alone when Rick's leadership is in doubt. Daryl asks Carol what she really wants, and she declares she wants "a man of honor"; Daryl responds, "Rick's got honor." </th>
