							<th height="250" width="600"> In the episode "No Sanctuary", shortly after being captured, the group plots their escape from the train cars as Daryl tells Maggie what happened to Beth. The Terminus crew drops tear gas in from the roof and take Daryl, Rick, Glenn and Bob to a slaughter room where four other survivors have their throats sliced. As Bob fails to reason with Gareth, telling him Eugene has a cure to the walker plague, an explosion caused by Carol and a subsequent invading walker herd distracts Gareth's attention and Rick gets free and kills the two butchers. Rick leads Daryl, Glenn and Bob back to the others where they escape Terminus as it is overrun by a walker herd and begins to burn down. Once outside the group runs into Carol; Daryl runs up to her and hugs her. In the episode "Strangers", the group continues to move along the forest but are distracted by a cry for help from Father Gabriel Stokes, who immediately strikes them all as suspicious after claiming to have not killed any walkers or people, but leads them to his church where they set up shelter. While searching for supplies later, Daryl and Carol find a car and manage to get it working. Daryl sees the car that took Beth drive by, and he and Carol go after it. In the episode "Four Walls and a Roof", the next day, Daryl emerges from the bushes where Michonne asks where Carol is but Daryl tells an unseen person to come out. </th>

							<th height="50" width="600"> Daryl's story is elaborated in the episode "Consumed", when he and Carol discover that cops have taken Beth. They lose track of the cops after their car fails to restart, and nevertheless travel into Atlanta and locate the distinct car again, on top of a parking lot next to the Grady Memorial hospital. While they sneak around and dodge walkers, they encounter Noah, unbeknownst to them a resident and survivor who met Beth. Noah holds them at gunpoint and forces them to surrender their weapons to him. Daryl and Carol comply and are left to deal with walkers freed by Noah to give him enough time to escape. Daryl catches up with Noah eventually and charges him to the ground. A large book shelf collapses on Noah and keeps him trapped while it releases a walker who approaches Noah. Daryl reluctantly complies with Carol's pleas for Noah's life, and Noah shares his story and the whereabouts of Beth. When the group is about to leave the building, two cops hit Carol with their car, seriously injuring her and leaving her unconscious. The cops take Carol away to their post, Grady Memorial Hospital. Noah calms Daryl, saying that they have will take care of her medically. Daryl vows to return for her with the rest of the survivors, countering Noah's argument that the cops have too much firepower to overwhelm them and Daryl leaves with Noah, revealing that he is the person Daryl brings back to the church. </th>

							<th height="50" width="1500"> In the episode "Crossed", Daryl, Rick, Tyreese, Sasha and Noah gear up and head to Atlanta to retrieve Beth and Carol, only to face complications with Officer Dawn Lerner's police subordinates Sargeant Bob Lamson and Officers Shepherd and Lacari. The group captures the three officers and Daryl suggests trading them for Beth and Carol. Eventually the group meets Dawn and her police in the hospital where they traded Lacari and Shepherd for Beth and Carol but when Dawn demanded Noah back Beth stabbed Dawn, prompting her to shoot Beth. Immediately Daryl shoots Dawn in the head before breaking down in tears and soon takes Beth's lifeless body outside, which the rest of the group arrives in time to see. </th>

							<th height="50" width="1500"> In the mid-season premiere "What Happened and What's Going On", Daryl is seen standing over Tyreese's funeral. In the episode "Them", two weeks after Beth's death, Daryl is still distraught and appears broken as the group also suffers from dehydration during a drought. Carol tells Daryl that he needs to embrace the pain so he can move on quicker before kissing him on the forehead. Later, Daryl goes into the woods to rest; he smokes a cigarette but then breaks down in tears. Later, when a storm hits, Daryl leads the group back to a barn he found, where they take shelter. Rick gives a speech about how they need to be dead inside if they want to survive so they can eventually live and calls the group "the walking dead", but Daryl argues that they are not the walkers. Daryl then later talks to Maggie and they help each other with their shared grief. In the episode "The Distance", Daryl pats Aaron down when he first enters the barn. He then agrees with Michonne about going to the community. He rides in the RV during the night, arriving at the flare which Eric fired unharmed. He then takes the RV to Alexandria. </th>

							<th height="50" width="1500"> In the episode "Remember", when the group enters the Alexandria Zone, Daryl is extremely cautious about the place and decides not to use any of the amenities they have given him, such as a shower, hence not putting his guard down. When interviewed by Deanna Monroe he refuses to sit down and arrives with his crossbow and a dead possum in his hands, greatly confusing Deanna about what job Daryl could have in the community. In the episode "Forget", Daryl secretly meets with Rick and Carol to discuss the matter of self-defense if things go bad. They kill a walker; Daryl notices a "W" carved into its forehead, leaving them slightly disturbed. Later, when hunting, Daryl runs into Aaron who is also hunting, and they subsequently work together to find a horse Aaron calls "Buttons", which Aaron has been trying to bring back for months. Aaron also notes Daryl's dilemma of fitting in as an outsider, and states that he and Eric feel the same way due to their sexuality. They later see Buttons killed by walkers, and Aaron puts Buttons down before they return. Aaron also encourages Daryl to attend Deanna's welcoming party for Rick's group. Daryl finds himself unable to and instead has dinner with Aaron and Eric before Aaron shows him his garage ful of bike parts, which Daryl can rebuild for himself. Aaron also offers him the job of being Eric's replacement as Alexandria's other recruiter, as he knows that Daryl will always need to be away from Alexandria; Daryl accepts and later, when meeting with Rick and Carol, he questions whether they need to carry hidden guns around and declines to take one. In the episode "Spend", Daryl has finished building his motorcycle, and heads out with Aaron in a car to find more recruits. </th>

							<th height="50" width="1500"> In the episode "Try", outside the walls, Daryl and Aaron notice more walkers are coming into the area. They investigate a light in the distance and come across a woman who had been tied to a tree and eaten alive by walkers. There is a "W" carved into her forehead. In the season finale "Conquer", Daryl and Aaron find evidence of other people moving around the forest and begin to track them. Aaron tells Daryl about how he recruited a group of survivors who were ultimately exiled from Alexandria, and he personally had to escort them out without their weapons. They then see a lone survivor wearing a red poncho in the middle of a field and follow him. They lose track of the survivor and decide to scavenge supplies from some abandoned food trucks. However, they set off a trap set by the Wolves that unleashes a horde of walkers on them and they are forced to take shelter inside a car. Daryl offers to risk his own life to help Aaron escape, but Aaron is adamant that they both escape together. At that moment, a survivor named Morgan arrives and, with his help, Daryl and Aaron are able to escape. They ask Morgan why he helped, and he replies that all life is precious. Aaron offers to bring him to Alexandria, but Morgan politely refuses, saying that he needs to get to Washington, D.C., and shows them the map he picked up in the church, which Daryl recognizes. Daryl, Aaron, and Morgan later arrive back in Alexandria in time to witness Rick execute Pete. </th>
