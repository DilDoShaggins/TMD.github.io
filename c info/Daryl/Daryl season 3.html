							<th height="250" width="600"> In the season premiere "Seed", Daryl and Rick find a prison complex while hunting. He helps the group clear out parts of the prison, but when they search a darkened area, Hershel is bit on the ankle by a walker. The group drags him to the prison cafeteria where Rick amputates Hershel's leg below the knee, and Daryl notices that five surviving prisoners are watching them. In the episode "Sick", Daryl, T-Dog, and Rick agree to help the prisoners (Tomas, Andrew, Oscar, Axel, and Big Tiny) clear out their own cellblock. Big Tiny is killed, and when Tomas and Andrew try to ambush Rick, Rick kills Tomas and chases Andrew into a courtyard filled with walkers, leaving him for dead. In the episode "Killer Within", Andrew, having survived, draws walkers into the prison courtyard, resulting in the deaths of Lori and T-Dog. Daryl and Oscar find Andrew struggling with Rick, and Oscar shoots Andrew before he can kill Rick. In the episode "Say the Word", while Rick goes off coming to terms with his wife's death, Daryl takes charge and, with Maggie's help, saves the newborn Judith by finding baby formula. When he thinks that Carol is dead, he puts a single Cherokee Rose on her grave, the same type flower that he gave her to give her hope in finding her daughter Sophia. In the episode "Hounded", Daryl finds a walker killed by Carol's knife, and then finds her alive. In the episode "When the Dead Come Knocking", Daryl witnesses Michonne being brought into the prison, and then directs Rick, Hershel, and Carl to a reunion with Carol. Rick and Daryl interrogate Michonne, who reveals that Maggie and Glenn have been captured and taken to Woodbury, a town ruled by the Governor. When Rick thanks him for saving Judith, Daryl merely says "It's what we do." Rick decides to take Daryl, Oscar, and Michonne with him to Woodbury. In the mid-season finale "Made to Suffer", during the group's attack on Woodbury, Daryl shoots and kills two guards. Later the group finds out that Merle is working for the Governor, and Daryl is captured when he goes searching for his brother. After accusing Merle of treason, the Governor orders the brothers to fight to the death in the Woodbury arena, with its citizens surrounding them and screaming with blood lust. </th>

							<th height="50" width="1500"> In the mid-season premiere "The Suicide King", Daryl and Merle escape after intervention from Rick and Maggie. Eventually, the present group members disagree with letting Merle back in. When Merle antagonizes the group, Rick knocks him out as they further discuss his re-entry. It is decided that they will not welcome Merle back; in response, Daryl leaves with Merle. In the episode "Home", Daryl saves a Mexican family from walkers with minimal help from Merle. Following the rescue, Merle attempts to loot the family's car but Daryl stops him. Daryl decides to go back to the prison; he and Merle get into an argument as Daryl walks away. Merle accidentally rips his shirt, revealing childhood scars on Daryl's back from their dad. Daryl hurriedly covers his back and walks off. Merle is hesitant to follow, as he knows he will never be accepted into the group, but he follows. They save Rick outside the prison when a herd of walkers are let loose by the Governor and his followers. In the episode "I Ain't a Judas", Daryl defends Merle's presence at the prison to the rest of the group. In the episode "Arrow on the Doorpost", Hershel and Daryl go along for support as Rick meets with the Governor to make an arrangement; Hershel spends the time conversing with Milton while Daryl banters with Martinez. In the episode "This Sorrowful Life", after Merle is killed by the Governor and becomes a walker, Daryl is forced to put him down. He takes the death with difficulty, crying and falling to the ground. In the season finale "Welcome to the Tombs", when the Governor brings a militia to attack the prison, the group fights them off and they flee. Rick, Daryl, and Michonne pursue them on foot, and find Karen, the only survivor of The Governor's militia after he slaughtered them. They go to Woodbury, where Tyreese and Sasha let them in. They find Andrea, dying from a walker bite, and say goodbye before she shoots herself. Daryl, Rick, Michonne, Tyreese, Sasha and Karen return to the prison with Andrea's body and the surviving Woodbury residents. </th>
