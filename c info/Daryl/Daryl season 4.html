							<th height="250" width="600"> In the episode "Alone", a flashback set a week before the season premiere shows Glenn and Daryl on a run when they encounter lone survivor Bob Stookey, who reveals he is the last survivor of two previous groups who were all killed. Daryl asks how many walkers and people he has killed, and Bob states that he has killed a few dozen walkers and one woman, on her request. After deeming him trustworthy enough, Glenn and Daryl give Bob a ride back to the prison. </th>

							<th height="50" width="600"> In the season premiere "30 Days Without an Accident", Daryl has become popular among the growing population at the prison for his proficiency at hunting. Daryl goes on a supply run with Sasha, Tyreese, Glenn, Michonne, Zach (Beth's new boyfriend), and Bob. Zach is bitten by a walker and killed, and when Daryl tells Beth the bad news she does not seem upset, and she claims that she has lost too many people to get upset anymore; Daryl confesses to being sick of seeing people die, and Beth hugs him. In the episode "Infected", Daryl helps clear out the cellblock when walkers attack, and the group finds out that a deadly infection is spreading among the population. Daryl and the rest of the prison's council agrees to start quarantining the sick, including Karen and another prisoner named David. In the episode "Isolation", when Tyreese goes looking for Karen and finds the burned bodies of Karen and David, he shows Rick, Daryl, and Carol. Daryl, Michonne, Bob, and Tyreese head to a veterinary college in search of antibiotics. They hear a message On the car radio, offering sanctuary at a place called Terminus, before the car is swarmed by walkers and they are forced to flee on foot. In the episode "Indifference", Bob confides his alcoholism to Daryl. They retrieve the medicine from the college, but Bob is nearly pulled into a group of walkers when they grab his bag. When Daryl finds a bottle of alcohol in the bag, he threatens Bob not to have a drink before treating the sick. In the episode "Internment", they return to the prison with the medicine, and Bob administers the antibiotics. In the mid-season finale "Too Far Gone", Rick tells Daryl that he banished Carol from the prison because she killed Karen and David. They go to tell Tyreese about this, but they are interrupted by the sound of an explosion before they can tell him. During the Governor's second assault on the prison, Daryl helps fend off the attackers, even blowing up a tank. Daryl escapes the prison with Beth. </th>

							<th height="50" width="1500"> In the episode "Inmates", after the group is split, Daryl and Beth are on the run together. Daryl acts despondent and says very little as they sit by a campfire. In the episode "Still", Beth and Daryl then find a moonshine shed much like the place Daryl grew up in, and stay for a bit. They get drunk and play a game of "Never Have I Ever", which leads to Daryl yelling at Beth after he gets offended by a question asked by Beth. He then drags her outside to shoot at a walker and gets into an argument about whether or not anyone else survived the prison attack. After they talk a bit and before they left they burn the house down with the moonshine and some money, flipping it off as it burns. In the episode "Alone", Daryl and Beth come across a funeral home, where they start to form a bond. When Beth asks Daryl what made him change his mind about whether there are still good people around, he simply stares at her, implying that she was the reason he changed his mind. Their moment is interrupted when Daryl hears what he thought was a dog at the door and opens to reveal a walker herd. Daryl fights off the herd, but Beth gets kidnapped in the chaos. Daryl runs after the car until morning, but stops after he comes to a fork in the road. He is then approached by a group of bandits led by Joe, and decides to join them when given the choice between joining their group or being killed. In the episode "Us", Daryl travels with Joe's group, learning its rules about who "claims" what and that they are tracking a man who recently killed one of their own. He also comes to aggressive odds with a member of the group when they indirectly mention Beth by saying, "I bet it's a bitch that's got you messed up", which almost prompts Daryl to kill the other member. In the season finale "A", Joe's group eventually catches up to the man they are tracking, who turns out to be Rick, along with Michonne and Carl and captures them. Daryl pleads with Joe to spare them as they are "good people". Joe calls him a liar and has two men try to beat him to death. However, when Joe informs Rick that the group is going to rape Michonne and Carl before killing him, Rick surprises everyone by biting out a chunk of Joe's neck, killing him. The distraction allows Daryl and Michonne to kill their captors while Rick disembowels Carl's captor. In the aftermath, Daryl tells Rick what had happened to him and Beth after the prison assault. Rick then states that the two are brothers. The group makes their way to Terminus, a supposed safe haven. A stealthy infiltration into Terminus still results in the small group being captured. The Terminus crew led by Gareth directs Rick, Daryl, Michonne, and Carl to a boxcar, where they find Glenn, Maggie, Sasha, Bob as well as Sgt. Abraham Ford, Eugene Porter, Rosita Espinosa and Tara Chambler. </th>
